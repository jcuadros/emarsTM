All members of the onsite fire brigade have received an integrative training of 120 hrs by the provincial fire department.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The accident analysis has pointed out the difficulties encountered in reaching the working area in which the accident occurred, due to the presence of permanent equipment structures and provisory structures. For this reason the company has adopted measures to facilitate the access to the working areas (e.g. mobile platforms) and in this way facilitate the evacuation of the personnel in case of an emergency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The decision to equip the personnel with additional pressure air cylinders has the objective to facilitate the evacuation in safe condition in case of emergency, allowing to shut down the central air circulation system and automatically switch to the reserve air cylinders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seveso II duties  - remarks: &lt;br&gt;The safety report dated 2000 has\nbeen evaluated with a negative result because the documentation\nprovided has been considered as insufficient. Presently the safety\nreport dated 2006 is under evaluation.\nThe accident scenarios considered in safety report did not take into\naccount the accident dynamics of this accident because it can not be\nclassified as accidental release. The accident was manged according to\nthe emergency response plan as generic emergency and as such was\ncompetence of the onsite fire brigade and the onsite sanitary service.\nThe conclusion concerning inadequate training and information level\nhave been taken from the official technical consultancy report given in\ncharge by the Attorney General's Office and refers specifically to the\npersonnel of external contractors and subcontractors. The report does\nnot make any reference concerning the behaviour of the ILVA worker, who\nrushed to the accident place without protective equipment.\n&lt;br&gt;"],"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastUser":{"UserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"Name":["MINERVA"],"Surname":["Administrator"],"IsVisibleSensibleData":[false]},"LastDate":["2017-07-11T15:59:38.731"],"ParentCompany":{},"Region":{},"Province":{},"City":{},"PostCode":{},"Concurrency":[0]},"LockedUserId":{},"LockedDate":{},"IsLocked":[false],"IsLockedByMe":[false],"LockedUser":{}},"AccidentProfile_Tab":{"ReportingAuthority":{},"ContactPerson":{},"Reasons":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Substances involved: greater than 5% of quantity in Column 3 of Annex I"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Injury to persons: &gt;= 1 fatalities, &gt;= 6 hospitalizing injuries etc."},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Immediate damage to the environment (according to Annex VI)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Damage to property: on-site &gt;2M &amp;euro;, off-site &gt; 0.5M &amp;euro;"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"Cross-border damage: transboundary accidents"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"Interesting for lessons learned."}],"AffectedCountries":{}},"AccidentDescription_Tab":{"AccidentDescription":{"DominoEffects":[false],"NatechEvents":[false],"TransboundaryEffects":[false],"Contractors":[true],"accTypeRelease":[0],"accTypeFire":[0],"accTypeExplosion":[0],"accTypeTransport":[0],"accTypeOther":{},"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastDate":["2017-07-11T16:00:08.689"],"Concurrency":[0],"Translation":{"VersionId":["e0e4443e-02e5-f753-41b7-6ab18afc2ee5"],"LanguageId":["EN"],"AccidentDescription":["The event occurred during the installation of a shut-off plate in a 3200mm pipeline containing blast furnace gas.

Further there deficiencies in the training programs for the personnel have been identified.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The analysis of the accident causes as described above was deduced from the documentation provided by ILVA and from the technical consultancy report requested by the Attorney-General's Office during the legal proceedings in course in date 14/3/2007.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In particular the conclusions of the technical consultancy report state that the fatal accident occurred because the victim had not been involved in an effective training and information process &lt;br&gt;-on the presence of CO in the working area, &lt;br&gt;-on the noxious effects of such gas if inhaled even for a very short period of time, and &lt;br&gt;- on the crucial requirement to wear permanently personal protective equipment. &lt;br&gt;This crucial requirement has not been respected by the worker during the operation, who several times removed his respirator mask to communicate over the phone. The behaviour of the worker is an infringement of the existing national norms D.LGs 629/94 and successive amendments and integrations, concerning art. 4,21 and
