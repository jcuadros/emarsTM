Checks were made immediately and showed that the product was escaping because the western side of the roof was starting to sink as it was taking in liquid from the pontoon sections on the same side.&lt;br&gt;The filling of the tank was interrupted at about 9.40 on 26 September 2014.&lt;br&gt;At about 10.30 on 26 September 2014, the refinery’s management decided to empty the tank as per the operating manual, in addition to implementing all the necessary preventive measures to ensure safety, namely: continuous attendance of firefighting vehicles; preventive covering of the product on the roof with a foam extinguisher; presence, in continuous shifts, of firefighting and technical operations teams for the emptying operation.&lt;br&gt;The layer of extinguisher was applied to the product on the roof at about 10.45 on 26 September 2014.&lt;br&gt;The operations staff started emptying TK&amp;nbsp;513 at about 12.20 on 26 September 2014.&lt;br&gt;In the hours that followed, the transfer of the product continued, whilst the layer of extinguishing foam was maintained by means of successive top-ups that were needed both to cover the product on the roof and owing to increased wind intensity.&lt;br&gt;At about 0.45 on 27 September 2014, the fuel was found to have started leaking and then the fire to have broken out on the tank roof. The level of the tank was estimated to be about 5.5&amp;nbsp;m (it had not been possible to gauge the level for several hours), corresponding to a volume of virgin naphtha of about 30&amp;nbsp;000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The internal emergency plan was put into action. The municipal and provincial fire brigades were notified.&lt;br&gt;The tank’s fire protection (cooling and foam spraying) systems were activated immediately. The cooling systems of three adjacent tanks were turned on. The cooling systems of two tanks located further to the south, beyond the embankment of a former railway, were later also turned on. It was possible to keep tank shell temperatures under control with the aid of a thermal sensor. Firefighting equipment and perimeter hydrants were used to protect the lines of transfer of the product in TK&amp;nbsp;513 from irradiance (north side), as was the rack to the south of the tank so as to prevent fire spreading to the vegetation on the trackbed of the former railway.&lt;br&gt;The fire brigade arrived on the scene. At about 2.00 on 27 September 2014, transfer of the product in TK513, interrupted when the emergency arose, was resumed in order to minimise the quantity of product burned.&lt;br&gt;At about 10.00 on 27 September 2014, the most intense phase of the fire seemed to have ended; there were far fewer flames but there was still some smoke activity. The tank's firefighting systems were found to be still active. The on-site and external firefighting teams remained in attendance and monitored the situation.&lt;br&gt;The end of the emergency was declared at about 17.30 on 27 September 2014.&lt;br&gt;On 28 September 2014, the situation was stable, with just one spot fire in the south side of the tank. In the meantime, the cooling of the tank shell, using the cooling ring and monitors, and the removal of the product both continued, although the pump was activated discontinuously by the operator.&lt;br&gt;Traces of smoke could still be detected in the air.&lt;br&gt;From 04.00 to 09.00 on 29 September 2014 there was a resurgence of smoke due to a number of residual spot fires.&lt;br&gt;There was another resurgence of smoke at approx. 9.00-14.00 on 30 September 2014, again due to a number of residual spot fires.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;In response to this, action is being taken, together with the provincial fire brigade HQ, to put in place fixed foam spraying systems with mounted monitors (including two high-power (7&amp;nbsp;000 and 10&amp;nbsp;000 lt/min) systems) in order to extinguish residual spot fires more quickly.&lt;br&gt;It was then decided to revert to cooling the shell and draining the tank.&lt;br&gt;At about 23.00 on 3 October, all the spot fires had been extinguished.&lt;br&gt;The company stated that the internal emergency plan (IEP) had been put into action immediately and had dealt with the emergency.

Filling and emptying operations were carried out in TK&amp;nbsp;513 in the days leading up to the accident.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;To ensure that such operations are performed correctly, the refinery subjects the tank to a series of inspections to assess the condition of its components, both major (base, roof, shell, foundations and leakproofing) and minor (drains, vents, etc.) The refinery carries out checks every three months and every three years.&lt;br&gt;According to the refinery’s inspection system records, internal inspections of TK&amp;nbsp;513 were carried out in 1985/86 and in 1998/99. The last general overhaul of the tank (1998/99) comprised the total replacement of its base and the application of protective epoxy paint, refurbishment of the tank’s main fittings (legs, shell-top access ways, surge pipes, stairways, coil, etc.) and the plating of parts of the topside of the caissons.&lt;br&gt;In addition, the company carried out UTS checks on TK&amp;nbsp;513 in 2008, and checks on its shell with the aid of a robotic system in 2011 to measure the thickness over the full height of its surface.

was contained wholly within the area of the roof and thus burned solely on the floating caissons, the fire being confined within the internal walls of TK&amp;nbsp;513.&lt;br /&gt; There were no spills or leakages into the containment basin, and no fire outbreak was recorded there.&lt;br /&gt;The company&amp;rsquo;s statements and the measurements and inspections carried out by the local Environmental Protection Agency branch indicate that there was no immediate damage to the environment or to persons. The air quality monitoring units did not record significant variations in the pollutant concentrations measured.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; This accident resulted in over EUR&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;million worth of material damage within the plant.&lt;br /&gt; The material damage was inspected within the refinery and was due to:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; - the loss of 6&amp;nbsp;000 tonnes (company estimate) of virgin naphtha in the tank,&lt;br /&gt; - the total destruction of floating-roof tank TK&amp;nbsp;513,&lt;br /&gt; - damage to the tank&amp;rsquo;s containment and extinguishing systems and to connecting pipes,&lt;br /&gt; - damage to one of the company&amp;rsquo;s own firefighting appliances,&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; - the clean-up and refurbishment of connecting devices,&lt;br /&gt; - the costs to be incurred in rebuilding the tank.&lt;br /&gt; According to the company, the consequences of the accident in terms of cost amount to about EUR&amp;nbsp;14&amp;nbsp;290&amp;nbsp;000.00, including:&lt;br /&gt; - approx. EUR&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;500&amp;nbsp;000.00 for the 6&amp;nbsp;000 tonnes of virgin naphtha that burned;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; - approx. EUR&amp;nbsp;9&amp;nbsp;790&amp;nbsp;000.00 for the decommissioning and subsequent rebuilding of TK&amp;nbsp;513.&lt;br /&gt;During the fire, fire brigade and refinery staff attended to the tank and the tanks close to it, and these were monitored by checking the critical temperatures of the materials. Therefore, the tank did not collapse and spill its contents into the containment basin, but it buckled on one side at about 10&amp;nbsp;m, of the initial 19&amp;nbsp;m, from the base.&lt;br /&gt;The tank-roof fire developed despite the measures taken, but the accident did not affect other installations or persons. It is clear that, although functioning, the fixed and mobile firefighting systems used during the accident did not enable the emergency services to keep the fire under control and/or to extinguish the fire immediately after its outbreak.&lt;br /&gt;The Prefecture did not consider it necessary to put the external action plan (EEP) into action.&lt;/p&gt;"],"Human":[0],"Environmental":[0],"Cost":[2],"Disruption":[0]},"HumanOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At
