The omissis Inspectorate has detected an infringement of the law, notably Section 6(1)(c), (d) and (f) of Act No 124/2006 on safety and health at work and amending certain acts and provisions, in that the organisation did not adequately assess the risk and also did not take safety measures to ensure safety and health at work so that a power cut or drop in the electricity supply does not result in an uncontrolled release of BFG to the air and put at risk the health and safety of employees and other persons present on the employer’s premises. The omissis Inspectorate has not imposed any penalties or issued a prohibition on the operation of the installation.&lt;br&gt;The omissis Environment Office has proposed measures to prevent major industrial accidents at the Company which it will apply rigorously to the operator in the imminent updating of the plant’s safety report provided for in Section 9 of Act No 261/2002 on the prevention of major industrial accidents and amending certain acts, as amended.&lt;br&gt;The major industrial accident at the Company occurred – and was caused – as result of a power supply failure and the subsequent failure of the plant’s technical and safety installations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"EmergencyResponce_Descr":["- called extraordinary emergency dispatching&lt;br&gt;- reduction of blast furnace gas supply&lt;br&gt;- refilling and closing of water seals&lt;br&gt;- evacuation of 311 persons&lt;br&gt;- closing of communications"],"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastUser":{"UserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"Name":["MINERVA"],"Surname":["Administrator"],"IsVisibleSensibleData":[false]},"LastDate":["2017-07-11T15:59:38.732"],"ParentCompany":{},"Region":{},"Province":{},"City":{},"PostCode":{},"Concurrency":[0]},"LockedUserId":{},"LockedDate":{},"IsLocked":[false],"IsLockedByMe":[false],"LockedUser":{}},"AccidentProfile_Tab":{"ReportingAuthority":{},"ContactPerson":{},"Reasons":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Substances involved: greater than 5% of quantity in Column 3 of Annex I"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Injury to persons: &gt;= 1 fatalities, &gt;= 6 hospitalizing injuries etc."},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Immediate damage to the environment (according to Annex VI)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Damage to property: on-site &gt;2M &amp;euro;, off-site &gt; 0.5M &amp;euro;"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"Cross-border damage: transboundary accidents"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"Interesting for lessons learned."}],"AffectedCountries":{}},"AccidentDescription_Tab":{"AccidentDescription":{"DominoEffects":[false],"NatechEvents":[false],"TransboundaryEffects":[false],"Contractors":[false],"accTypeRelease":[0],"accTypeFire":[0],"accTypeExplosion":[0],"accTypeTransport":[0],"accTypeOther":{},"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastDate":["2017-07-11T16:00:08.689"],"Concurrency":[0],"Translation":{"VersionId":["68800475-1309-a312-4cc2-a970526536a6"],"LanguageId":["EN"],"AccidentDescription":["At 06:37 on 16 November 2006 the plant experienced a drop in its power supply, i.e. a reduction in voltage on lines 277 and 278, which supply the plant with electricity from the nearby substation. This brief drop in voltage triggered the closure of the BFG supply pipes, resulting in the shut-down of the main BFG draw-off points (heating-plant boilers Nos 1, 3, 5 and 6, and the combustion boilers of push furnaces 1 and 4) and other, smaller BFG draw-off points at the plant. This caused a substantial increase in pressure in the main BFG distributor (about 16 kPa), followed by the extinction of the burners on BFG stacks 2 and 3 (increase in BFG flow to maximum) and the bursting open of pressure traps on the main BFG distributor (26 traps). This resulted in a release of BFG, which was signalled by the CO monitoring system (external and internal CO monitoring at the plant). The CO release was reported at 06:45 and emergency control arrangements were put in place; the Energy Division’s control centre requested a reduction in the supply of BFG by 200 000 Nm3/hour, by reducing blasting. At the same time, action was taken by the company’s own fire brigade (air quality monitoring, adding and closing of pressure traps, evacuation of employees), and by the company’s private security service (closure of roads). After the necessary technical measures had been performed on the installations (gradual ignition of the burners of the heating plant boilers and of the combustion boilers of the push furnaces, shut-down of blast furnace No 2 – interruption of the blasting of hot air, resulting in a reduction in the production of iron and of BFG), pressure in the main BFG distributor gradually fell until a stable value of 2-6 kPa was reached. At 08:00, the levels of released CO in the air were falling, as most of the pressure traps had already been closed. At 09:05, the company's fire brigade stopped monitoring CO levels at the plant and in its immediate vicinity; the CO values were within the legal limits. The evacuation was completed; production continued unchanged after the MIA had been dealt with. Seven vehicles equipped with measuring devices for monitoring CO releases to air were deployed.The evacuation of the plant’s employees and employees of external firms was organised and directed by controllers from the Coking Plant, Hot-Rolling, Cold-Rolling, Transport, Service and Energy Divisions, and implemented by the company’s fire brigade, company's fire brigade, and its private security service. A total of 359 people were evacuated. The evacuation point was determined in accordance with the divisional emergency plans and in line with measurements taken using personal analysers; nobody was injured during the evacuation.&lt;br&gt;No injuries were sustained by employees and no damage was done to technical installations during the MIA, the major occurrence of which took place between 06:37 and 08:45.&lt;br&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;

In order to direct or close off the flow, the distributor is divided up and delimited by section valves. The main BFG distributor is equipped with pressure traps which act as a safeguard if the pressure exceeds 12kPa. There are 32 of them. Connected to the BFG distributor are, amongst other things, combustion stacks 2 and 3, which are used to burn residual BFG. At the top of the stacks are burners which are supplied with natural gas, with the aid of which the BFG is burnt.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Pressure traps which had burst open after critical pressure values in the region of 18kPa were exceeded were the source of the MIA. Out of the total number of pressure traps, 26 had burst open, five had been taken out of operation owing to an overhaul of the BFG storage tank, and one – A248 – had not burst open (as recorded by CO sensors). Combustion stacks 2 and 3, which released non-combusted BFG, were another source.&lt;br&gt;The Company's plant is equipped with external and internal CO leakage monitoring systems.
