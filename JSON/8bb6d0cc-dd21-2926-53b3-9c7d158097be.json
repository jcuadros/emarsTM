The event was attributed an event frequency\nof 6,5x10 E-8. The extent of the event was over-estimated in terms of\nsource (110 kg/s of release flow, against approximately 20 kg/s\nevaluated for the real case), but under-estimated for the effects: the\ndomino effect involving nearby units was not considered. For the\njet-fire the radius of the damage zone was calculated as 140 m for a\nduration of 10 seconds. The thermal collapse of the nearby equipment\nwas considered as unlikely due to the short duration of the jet.\nDomino effects on nearby units are however mentioned in the safety\nmanual, in which the evaluation of potential interactions between\ndifferent units is considered.\nIn the information sheet a more severe accident scenario is also\nconsidered although referring to different accident dynamics.\nIn the Onsite Emergency Response Plan the accident that occurred could\nbe compared with the accident scenario that considers the rupture of a\ngas or LPG pipeline. The representatives of the refinery stated that\nthe procedure had been started to update the Onsite Emergency Response\nPlan to the accident scenarios identified in the Safety Report.\nThe Onsite Emergency Response Procedure appears to be almost adequate,\nit defines in detail the emergency response operations to be performed\nin the plant sections involved, but needs to be improved, in particular\nwith respect to the location of the fire fighting equipment and\ninstallations.

Reaching the place the person in charge realised that the noise was caused by compressor K-2901B and tried to stop the compressor via the emergency shut-off switch installed on the control panel near the compressor, then he went to the control room to order the activation of the emergency shut-down procedure, with the activation of the discharge system into the fuel-gas network and the rapid depressurisation by the blow down system.&lt;br&gt;Immediately afterwards the violent release of a hydrogen rich gas mixture occurred from the compressor bottom, the jet ignited almost instantly and hit the adjoining part of the BenSat plant (approximately 14m). The refinery personnel closed the manual valves installed on the pipe mains and started extinguishing operations, activating the fixed cooling systems and the foaming system of the units involved and nearby units.&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile (at 15:03 hrs) the onsite Emergency Control Centre team gathered and established communication with the Advanced Control Centre. At 15:12 hrs the Emergency Control Centre decided to alert the off-site fire brigade. Meanwhile the on-site emergency response team fought the fire from the southeast with a fixed high capacity monitor, from the south with two UNI45 extinguishing hoses, another fixed monitor positioned in the southwest, an extinguishing lorry with a monitor positioned on the northwest, two UNI170 extinguishing hoses in the northeast.&lt;br&gt;At 15:16 hrs the Emergency Control Centre ordered the emergency shut-down procedure to be started for the entire establishment.&lt;br&gt;At 15:30 the first off-site fire brigade team arrived on-site and started to support response operations on the north side, which was more exposed due to the wind blowing from the south and a major presence of fixed extinguishing systems on the south side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The size of the fire was greatly reduced by 15:50 because the compression section of the plant no longer fed the fire; the fire continued in the BenSat unit engulfing it with flames.&lt;br&gt;At 16:25 the fire was practically extinguished, some small flames remained on the highest points; cooling operations continued. At 16:50 the emergency was called off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, at 15:26, the Mayor's office, the Carabinieri and the Prefecture were informed about the occurrence. During the emergency also the 118 - (sanitary emergency call number) intervened at 15:45 hrs. On-site, besides the Fire Brigade Commander of Rome, and the General Fire Brigade Inspector of the Latium Region, also the Prefect and a journalist from the news of the third national Television chain arrived at the refinery (respectively at 16:49 hrs and at 16:52 hrs); representatives from the police headquarters also arrived.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Official action taken - legal action: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;At time of the present report a confrontation was in progress between the company and the supplier of the compressor.

The compressors, which were working in parallel and were operating at a pressure of 20 bars, were dedicated to conveying the gas mixture needed for the isomerisation process. The rupture caused the release of a gas mixture containing hydrogen, which on coming into contact with air ignited forming a jet fire. The jet fire headed towards the adjacent benzene saturation (BenSat) section hitting the nearest equipment (a pressure vessel) located 14 m from the release point. Weakening of the BenSat structure, consequent release of benzene from these structures and extension of the fire, with substantial destruction of the section. The length of the jet-fire could not be calculated with precision because the flame hit against the nearby BenSat unit; if the jet had not been stopped by the BenSat unit, it could have had an estimated length of approximately 30 m.&lt;br&gt;Off-site fire brigade teams intervened extinguishing the fire within approximately 1 hour and a half of work.

This rupture was probably caused by a failure of the crank mechanism made of piston rod and drive shaft that caused the beating of the piston on the cylinder-bottom of the compressor. The combined effect of the beating and of the operation pressure may have caused the failure of the nuts holding the cylinder bottom; the following energy release threw the cylinder bottom weighing 100 kg approximately 14 meters away.&lt;br&gt;Due to the fact that the process control records did not register significant changes in the process parameters it has to be assumed that the failure of the crank mechanism was caused by aspects linked to maintenance or by a material defect.&lt;br&gt;At time of this report investigations were being performed on the material fragments of the failed crank components. An official systematic investigation on the failure cause with an expert appointed by the court is expected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The clearance in the compressor between piston and cylinder bottom is 3 mm. According to the declarations of the operator, it appears evident that a mechanical interference between cylinder bottom and drive shaft may have occurred.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The nuts holding the failed cylinder bottom were found with completely abraded threads whereas the bolts on the contrary were practically undamaged and a few were just slightly blackened.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The flammable gas mixture was probably ignited by the beating and the friction of the failed crank mechanism or by an electrostatic charge built up through gas seepage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"Other":[""]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment
