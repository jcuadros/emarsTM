The company deployed the manually operated fixed extinguishing system and used two hydrant-connected UNI45 hoses to put out the flames in station D1, one dry powder extinguisher for the flames engulfing the victim’s legs and a fire blanket on the victim. The emergency was managed by three members of the internal emergency team to put out the fire, two people to give the victim first aid and one person to communicate with outside bodies, the medical emergency services and fire brigade. No alarm was sounded to evacuate staff from the plant, because the evacuation alarm system was undergoing maintenance when the accident occurred.

The bottom of the drum was blown off by the pressure that had built up due to deflagration inside, causing the liquid in the drum, which was by now in flames, to spill out violently, partly onto the ground and partly onto the driver, who was taken to hospital with burns on 80% of his body and died 15 days later. The resulting fire spread to only a minor extent because it was fuelled essentially only by the spilled liquid. The quantity of liquid involved is estimated to be essentially the content of the pipeline, from the auxiliary pump situated at pavilion&amp;nbsp;D to the dispenser nozzle, i.e. a quantity corresponding to the final stage of drum-filling (feeding in the last remaining liquid). Given the dimensions of the pipeline (approx. 22 m long and 1 ½” in diameter), this quantity is around of 25 litres max., equal to 22&amp;nbsp;kg. The explosion of the drum can probably be attributed to the flammable atmosphere that had developed inside it igniting; such a flammable atmosphere normally forms above the free surface of a flammable liquid such as normal butyl acetate (flash point +27&amp;nbsp;C°), which was the product being transferred when the accident occurred. The fire was put out within a few minutes with the fixed extinguishing equipment located in the drum-filling building and through the use of outside hydrants by the internal emergency team. The local fire brigade was called and arrived quickly on the scene when the fire had already been put out. The fire brigade finished the emergency intervention and securing of the site within a few minutes and took instrument readings to check whether flammable substances were present in the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;

Its main customers are pharmaceutical companies. Products are primarily delivered by the exclusive transporter XX. Once at the plant, the products are unloaded and stored in underground tanks, into which they are transferred from the tanker trucks by gravity using closed-circuit systems and a flexible hose. The store has 50 underground tanks for commercial use plus three underground gas-oil/diesel tanks for internal use: one tank for gas-oil to power the boiler for the heating system, one tank for diesel used as fuel for the firm’s vehicles and one tank for diesel for the back-up generator. Tanks 15 to 27 differ from the others due to the innovative technological design with which they were built. According to the firm, the objective was to prevent any possibility of product leaking into the ground (double wall with continuous leak monitoring). All the tanks are fitted with a level probe and an atmospheric vent system with flameproof mesh. Lastly, there is a small above-ground tank containing lubricating oils (capacity 4 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) located in building C.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Three buildings are used to store various products in drums:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Building A: Flammable and/or toxic products, products that are toxic for the environment (e.g.&amp;nbsp;butyl acetate, toluene, acetone, ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol, cyclohexane, etc.);&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Building B: Non-flammable and/or non-toxic products (chlorinated compounds, e.g. methylene chloride, perchloroethylene, etc.);&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Building C: Flammable products and/or products toxic for the environment (e.g. hexane, heptane, medium oils, white spirit, odourless mineral spirit, lubricating oils, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Based on the operator’s description, the buildings were built with incombustible, fireproof materials (reinforced concrete frame and brick cladding).&amp;nbsp; The buildings can be easily evacuated in the event of fire, since they have outward-opening metal doors at least 0.70&amp;nbsp;m wide.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The containment basin for leaks comprises perimeter drainage channels located within and around each building, leading to a 100&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; API-separator sedimentation tank.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the case under examination, the buildings are completely isolated from other structures by open spaces. Ventilation is provided by vents in the perimeter walls, at both floor and ceiling level. The buildings have polished concrete floors. Lastly, there is a building whose basement is used as a chemical laboratory used to analyse the incoming and, sometimes, outgoing products to test their purity. This is because pharmaceutical customers require very pure products (to ppm level). That building also features changing rooms and offices on the first floor and guard accommodation on the second floor. The products sold, which again are largely distributed by the exclusive firm XX, leave the plant primarily in bulk form (approx. 95%) in tanker trucks, and to a lesser extent in packaged form (in 200-litre metal drums) on dumper trucks. In the latter case, the products are transferred from the relevant tanks into drums. Flammable products, whether on their own or mixed into requested formulations, are transferred into drums in the designated buildings, i.e. buildings A and C.&lt;/p&gt;"],"Installation_Description":["&lt;p&gt;The event originated in building A, which has a footprint of around 600&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and is where flammable acetates (including the butyl acetate involved in the event) are transferred into drums. As declared by the operator and indicated in the official technical expert’s report, the building is classified as an area with the possible presence of explosive atmospheres (zone 2) within the meaning of Directive 94/9/EC. The building is protected by a manual sprinkler system.&amp;nbsp; Inside the building the drums are stored on roller conveyors where they await loading by forklift onto vehicles for delivery to clients. The roller conveyors are made up of Teflon-coated rollers and are equipotentially bonded to the general earthing system, which is tested twice a year by a notified body. The building features two entirely symmetrical loading stations, known as D1 and D2, each with two pipelines for transferring products and equipped, among other things, with two dispenser nozzles, a scales, an earth clamp and a manually-operated extractor fan. Station D1 has a dispenser nozzle linked to the pipeline fed by the auxiliary pump located outside the building under pavilion D; this is the pipeline on which the accident occurred. The other dispenser nozzle in station D1 is linked to the pipelines fed by underground tanks&amp;nbsp;1-14 located outside the building. Product may be transferred from the underground tanks to Building A either via dedicated pipelines or (in cases where product purity specifications are particularly high, as in the case under examination) via mobile containers (IBCs with a capacity of 1&amp;nbsp;000 litres or ATBs). In such cases, the specific route followed by butyl acetate is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the product is transferred from underground tank 40 to 1 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; IBCs in closed circuit at pavilion B using a loading arm;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the filled IBCs are moved manually by forklift from pavilion B to pavilion D, and specifically to the auxiliary pump located outside building A, which is used to transfer the product to drum-filling station D1 via a pipeline;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the product is transferred from the IBC to drum-filling pipeline D1 using the auxiliary pump;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the product is loaded into a drum at station D1 in building A, which is where the event occurred.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When drums are being filled, after the upper rim of the drum has been connected to the earth clamp and the extractor fan has been turned on and placed close to the drum opening, the operative fills it by inserting and turning on the dispenser nozzle and activating the pump. In the case of station D1, where the dispenser nozzle is connected to the auxiliary pump outside, the operative turns on the pump and the extractor fan via a button console located close to the scales. The drum to be filled comes from an overhead roller conveyer (the empty drum conveyor) along which empty drums from the storage area are transferred. The empty drum drops onto a roller conveyer located at ground level, from which it is moved onto a second roller conveyer which transfers it to the scales, which acts as a filling and weighing station. Once it has been filled, the drum is moved to a third roller conveyer shared between the two filling stations and placed onto a line that transfers the full drum to the storage area within the same building. The solvent transfer system works in such a way as to ensure that the velocity of the product within the pipes does not exceed 1 m/s (this is necessary to minimise the formation of electrostatic charges).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Equipment associated with the event: 200-litre ADR-approved metal drum featuring a 2”&amp;nbsp;bung hole and a vent, painted on the outside. After use, the drums received back from clients are refurbished by a specialised firm.&amp;nbsp; The company buys refurbished drums with the desired specifications from that firm. Refurbishment involves, among other things, cleaning and possibly repainting the drum.&lt;/p&gt;"],"Other":[""]}},"SiteStorageMajors":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"process-associated

It is a ‘mono-component’, i.e. both a raw material and a finished product, since the plant does not carry out processing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;CAS number:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 123-86-4&lt;br&gt;Molecular mass:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 116.16&amp;nbsp;g/mol&lt;br&gt;Chemical formula:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Physical state:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; liquid&lt;br&gt;Colour:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; colourless&lt;br&gt;Melting point:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;-78&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;br&gt;Boiling point:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 124 - 126.5 °C (1.013 hPa)&lt;br&gt;Flash point:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 27&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;br&gt;Ignition temperature:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 415&amp;nbsp;°C&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Vapour pressure:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 15 hPa (20 °C)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 63 hPa (50 °C)&lt;br&gt;Density:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;0.8812 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (20 °C)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Relative density of vapour (air):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;4 (air = 1) at 20 °C&lt;br&gt;Evaporation rate:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 1.0 (n-butyl acetate = 1)&lt;br&gt;Lower explosive limit:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 1.2&amp;nbsp;% vol.&lt;br&gt;Upper explosive limit:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 7.5&amp;nbsp;% vol.&lt;/p&gt;"],"Other":[""]}},"SubstanceClassification":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"01.

In this context, an official technical expert was appointed and submitted a report. The expert’s report formulates the hypothesis, which the operator agreed with during the site inspection, that the flammable mixture ignited because of an electrostatic discharge caused by the earth clamp not being properly in contact with the drum. Indeed, as confirmed on site during the inspection, the clamp did not have an interlock system. Such a system allows product to be transferred into a drum only once earthing has been confirmed. In addition, the drum-filling area did not have any system for detecting potentially hazardous atmospheres. These issues were mentioned in the technical report dated 30&amp;nbsp;October 2015, which was drawn up by the working group appointed by the control authority to check on the instructions issued following the examination of the 2011 Safety Report and to analyse the accident. The report indicated, among other things, that the Operating Instruction entitled “Critical area: filling drums with substances and mixtures using the auxiliary pump. Managing drum filling under normal, anomalous and emergency conditions: building A, zone D1, tanks 15 to 21” version 10/2014, drawn up by the company within its safety management system and examined by the working group, does not deal with the transfer of butyl acetate. The Operating Instruction also requires the use of an earth clamp but does not envisage a check that equipotential bonding has actually taken place. It also provides that drum-filling be halted in the event of an anomaly, with the definition of anomaly being given in general terms in a separate procedure. The accident probably happened when the last remaining liquid in the pipeline was being fed in, with vapours inside the drum igniting, causing the explosion. It is interesting to note that it is when the last acetate residues are being fed in that the risk is highest of an explosive atmosphere forming inside the drum above the free surface of the liquid phase, since the quantity of liquid being added is low. Under such conditions it is more likely that the flammable mixture will be within the flammable range. The details outlined above are confirmed in the official technical expert’s report.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Another matter to consider concerns the training of the victim: as stated by the operator and in the report, his job description as a driver did not include transferring products into drums (even though the worker was probably aware of the procedures for carrying out this operation, at least from having watched other staff do it). In addition, a further ‘aggravating’ factor in the accident that caused the death of the worker caught up in the explosion is that this death could probably have been avoided if the worker had been wearing all the personal protective equipment (overalls, helmet, etc.) required when filling drums, in particular fireproof antistatic overalls, which would have protected the area of his body that was most seriously burned by the flames. Indeed, the operator has stated that, when the explosion occurred, the deceased worker was wearing antistatic shoes and gloves but no overalls, helmet or goggles. Lastly, on the day of the accident, the fact that the worker was not using personal protective equipment was not noted/remarked upon either by colleagues who were involved in other transfer operations but did come into contact with him, or by management staff supervising operations and present that day in the offices.&lt;/p&gt;"],"Other":[""]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment

injury/death.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The event caused the death of the worker filling the drum. The fact that the vapours inside the drum ignited caused them to explode. The bottom of the drum was blown off by the pressure that had built up due to the deflagration inside, and the liquid in the drum, which was by now in flames, spilled out violently, partly onto the ground and partly onto the worker, who was burned on his face, torso, upper and lower limbs &amp;ndash; a total of 80% of his body &amp;ndash; sparing only his upper thorax, inner abdomen, hands and the soles of his feet (because of the protective gloves and shoes). The worker was immediately given first aid and taken to hospital, where he died of complications 15 days later (on 31 July 2015).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Material damage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fire spread to only a minor extent because it was fuelled essentially only by the spilled liquid. It caused limited damage to drum-filling station D1 inside building A. During the inspection committee&amp;rsquo;s site inspection, station D1 still showed evident damage caused by direct flame exposure, both at ground level and on devices and equipment up to a height of around 6&amp;nbsp;m above ground. As indicated in the official technical expert&amp;rsquo;s document and declared by the operator:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"&gt;all the components present were damaged: the roller conveyor delivering drums, the roller conveyor bringing drums to the scales, the button console, the scales, the local extractor fan and the dispenser nozzle.

In the surrounding area, five drums exploded and their bottoms and lids can be seen in the photos taken by the official technical expert. One of the exploded drums lost its bottom, whilst the lid, without the cap, remained attached. There were caps on the lids of all the other exploded drums. The vapour extractor was found burned and positioned above the drum. There was no evidence to state whether it had been turned on. The auxiliary pump was found switched on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, the damage observed can be attributed to the results of a pool fire resulting from the spillage onto the ground of a relatively minor quantity of flammable liquid and a number of deflagrations within some drums.&lt;/p&gt;"],"Human":[1],"Environmental":[0],"Cost":[2],"Disruption":[0]},"HumanOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","Quantity":1,"Effect":"","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"HumanOffSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"DetailHumanOffSite":{},"DetailHumanOnSite":{},"DetailHumanEmergency":{},"EnvironmentalOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"inland: metropolitan development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"inland: urban development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"inland: rural development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"inland: parkland/commonland","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"inland: grassland/pasture/meadow","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"inland: arable land/crops/vineyards/orchards","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"inland: woodland;
