Steam was admitted to the toaster and to the jackets of hexane/miscella inlet pipes to heat-up the toasters and the extractor to the proper operating temperatures. At about 21:45 the toasters reached their operating temperature and admittance of flakes commenced through the inlet screw conveyor. After that, the following events occurred (the time shown had been approximately evaluated on instrument readings and information from the staff, as no log was in operation) until the explosion took place at 00:47:&lt;br&gt;- 22:45 to 23:00: The night shift took over and at the same time the first flakes dropped from the outlet screw conveyor into the toasters.&lt;br&gt;- 23:15: The toaster temperature dropped to 85°C. The plant operator therefore opened fully for the steam flow to the toaster jackets and the upper parts (direct steam) of the toasters. About the same time the safety flap valve was heard lifting releasing hexane and steam into the extractor building, where the smell of hexane was detected by the operators. This was, however, not an abnormal occurrence during the start-up.&lt;br&gt;- 23:25: One of the flake outlet conveyors stopped due to overloading and the interlocking system stopped the flake inlet conveyor and the internal belt conveyor but not the other outlet conveyor nor the steam and hexane flows. High hexane concentrations were detected in the extractor building. The plant operator, however, was of the opinion that the steam and hexane flows were stopped according to the operation procedure.&lt;br&gt;- 23:35: The flake outlet conveyor was restarted and the operating staff began to search for the hexane release point but without success. The hexane concentration in the extraction building finally reached a level which forced the staff out of the extractor building.&lt;br&gt;- 23:55: A bus driver passing the facility detected the hexane vapours and about the same time the sprinkler system below the extractor was activated by the released hot hexane/steam mixture.&lt;br&gt;- 00:15: The operating staff left the facility and from the Gate called in assistance of staff which were not on duty, including the chief plant operator (CPO). At the same time they stopped the above mentioned bus driver, when he was to pass again warning him against the possible danger. The bus driver informed the Traffic Control Center, which in turn alarmed the Police and the Fire Brigade.&lt;br&gt;- 00:25: The first Fire Brigade unit arrived and decided to call in further assistance.&lt;br&gt;- 00:35: The Chief Plant Operator (CPO) and the Fire Inspector on Duty arrived. The CPO went into the extractor building and located the leak to the safety flap, from which gas/liquids clearly appeared.&lt;br&gt;- 00:40-00:45: The CPO and the Fire Inspector discussed how to stop the outflow of hexane vapours and decided to do this by cutting off the power supply. They called the power plant engineer and asked him to do it. Due to the inherent risk of possible sparks he rejected to stop the loaded transformers and instead, for unknown reasons, disconnected a third unloaded transformer at about 00:47.&lt;br&gt;- 00:47.30: A fire seen in the far end of the extractor yard was spotted followed by a strong explosion injuring 27 persons (staff members, firemen and police officers) and damaging completely 6 buildings."],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;

Based on the investigations carried out, it has been concluded that excessive amounts of steam leaking from the toaster to the extractor led to lifting and relocating of the safety flap valve. The steam leaking from the toaster to the extractor occurred due to lack of flakes in the outlet screw conveyors, which acted as a barrier against steam/gas flow. As a consequence, hexane was released and led to an explosion. Based on the available information it seems clear that the explosion was initiated by the disconnection of a transformer which ignited the hexane cloud.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CAUSES&lt;br&gt;The leakage of hexane (flammable/explosive gas) was due to the incorrect operation of the safety flap valve caused by the failure of the interlocking system to cut-off the steam and hexane flows to the toaster when one of the extractor outlet conveyors was stopped. An unloaded transformer, disconnected by mistake just before the explosion, is believed to have caused the ignition of the hexane vapours cloud.&lt;br&gt;"],"Other":[""]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["51d2c43f-f83c-ac85-9193-2c9bd85d4f9e"],"Consequence_Description":["EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:&lt;br&gt;27 people (staff members, firemen and police officers) were injured by the explosion of the hexane vapours cloud.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MATERIAL LOSS:&lt;br&gt;The plant (6 buildings) was totally destroyed by the explosion and, outside the establishment, the windows were broken up to a distance of 1.5 km.
