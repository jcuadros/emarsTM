In error, hydrochloric acid began to be poured into a container that had previously held sodium chlorite, with residues estimated at approx. (&amp;gt;=) 1.6 kg still being present.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is believed that the chemical reaction which caused the explosion can be explained by hydrochloric acid mixing with sodium chlorite.&lt;br&gt;The stoichiometry of the reaction between sodium chlorite and hydrochloric acid is as follows: 5NaClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4HCl -&amp;gt; 4ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 5NaCl + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O The reaction leads to the formation of ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (chlorine dioxide) which, as indicated on the safety data sheet (SDS Code: 50084, ClorDisys Solutions, Inc.) can give rise, in the gaseous phase, to spontaneous explosive decomposition in concentrations exceeding 10% v/v (low-order explosion).
