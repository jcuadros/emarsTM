The whole site contained plants covered by the requirements of Article 5; this specific plant did not however fall under the requirements of Artcile 5. The manufacturer had nevertheless prepared a safety report, which was submitted to the competent Authority at the correct time. This report categorized the process as relatively low risk (the reaction was only mildly exothermic and not very sensitive to small operational variations). The process included the production of difluoronitrobenzene (DFNB) by reacting dichloronitrobenzene (DCNB) with potassium fluoride at a temperature of 165°C and atmospheric pressure. DFNB was purified by centrifuge and distillation and was subsequently hydrogenated to difluoroaniline (DFA), an intermediate for the pharmaceutical industry. DCNB and DFNB were identified as substances which could decompose violently at temperatures above 220°C but no circumstances were foreseen which could result in the temperature of the mixture being raised by such a large amount above the normal operating temperature. A few weeks before the accident, the distillation mixture had been contaminated with water through two leaking valves. It was believed that the water had been removed by distillation. During the heating phase the operators realized that the temperature was rising fast, but could do little to control it. The reactor vented, flames were seen to ignite at the top of the reactor and then an explosion occurred, followed by a serious fire. Tank storage of xylene was ignited at an early stage and prolonged the fire.&lt;br&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;

The failure of the two valves and the subsequent gross water contamination were the first critical initiating events. There was an attempt to remove the water using a second distillation on the water/toluene intercut. Failure to remove water may have been due to phase separation of water in the base of the main distillation column. The dimethylacetamide (DMAC) solvent was hydrolized to acetic acid. It was known that DMAC does not easily hydrolyse to acetic acid, but fluoroaromatic compounds acted as catalysts (this catalytic property was not previously known) causing an increased acetic acid production. Acetic acid was accumulate in the DMAC because of the similar boiling points. It is worth noting that the accident occurred when the batch loaded into the reactor was the first one to completely use recycled DMAC following its contamination with water. Laboratory investigations have shown that 2-10% w/w acetic acid in DMAC gives a reproducible rapid exothermic reaction at 140-160°C, producing a high yield of higher weight molecular substances with evolution of gas (CO2). This lower temperature exothermic reaction drove the temperature up to that which initiated the violent decomposition of the nitrobenzene compounds. Metallurgical examinations indicated that the vessel failed at about 20-25 bar and 500°C, conditions far above its design pressure and substantially higher than its test pressure. Cooling through both the external jacket and the open vent to a knock-out pot could not cope with the violent decomposition and prevent the pressure build-up in the reactor.&lt;br&gt;"],"Other":[""]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["d611ffff-d8e6-a0eb-69ae-f3137c7c9da9"],"Consequence_Description":["EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:&lt;br&gt;One operator was on the plant at the time of the explosion. Although he was covered by reactants/products and fell a distance of 6 metres, he suffered nothing worse than a broken leg and was recovered strongly. Unexpectedly, he died 20 days later from post-operative complications. The other 2 plant operators and 3 operators in a nearby control room from an adjacent plant received relatively minor injuries. During the plant demolition, strict controls were used to monitor the workers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MATERIAL LOSS:&lt;br&gt;A large part of the CFA plant was destroyed while nearby plants suffered serious structural damage (missile were thrown uo to 500 metres away). There was little material damage outside the plant complex (broken windows and minor roof damages up to 1.2 km away). The immediate area of the installation was heavily contaminated and slight etching of windscreens and paintwork of a couple of car was caused by hydrogen fluoride precipitation. The plant was subsequently demolished.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:&lt;br&gt;The accident broke windows and caused minor roof damages up to 1.2 km away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Ecological harm - Remarks: &lt;br&gt;Though during the fire combustion products were released inair and deposited onto ground, in the Original Report there is no evidence of significant ecological harms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Affected Area: installation&lt;br&gt;Affected Area: establishment&lt;br&gt;Affected Area: off-site: local&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"Human":[1],"Environmental":[0],"Cost":[1],"Disruption":[0]},"HumanOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","Effect":"Establishment Population: 6","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","Quantity":1,"Effect":"Establishment Population: 1","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","Effect":"Establishment Population: 5","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"HumanOffSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","Effect":"Emergency Personnel : -1 OffSite Population : -24577","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"DetailHumanOffSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Establishment total at risk","Quantity":-24577,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"immediate fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"subsequent fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"hospitalizing injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other serious injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"health monitoring","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true}],"DetailHumanOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Establishment total at risk","Quantity":6,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"immediate fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"subsequent fatalities","Quantity":1,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"hospitalizing injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other serious injuries","Quantity":5,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"health monitoring","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true}],"DetailHumanEmergency":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Establishment total at risk","Quantity":-1,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"immediate fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"subsequent fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"hospitalizing injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other serious injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"health monitoring","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true}],"EnvironmentalOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"inland: metropolitan development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"inland: urban development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"inland: rural development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"inland: parkland/commonland","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"inland: grassland/pasture/meadow","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"inland: arable land/crops/vineyards/orchards","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"inland: woodland;
