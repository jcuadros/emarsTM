The process is based on the capacity of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) to polymerise by radical reaction, once the reaction is triggered with specific catalysers. VCM is first dispersed in water with specific agents, which have also the function to determine some of the final characteristics of the PVC resin.&lt;br&gt;Once the reaction is finished, the slurry of composed by PVC and water is discharged in the stripping section, where it is processed in a stripping column with steam: this operation reduces in normal conditions the residual VCM content to maximally 10 ppm . The stripped slurry is successively sent to the drying zone, where&amp;nbsp; first by centrifugation and then by drying, the resin is dried and transferred to storage. The final resin, with a total VCM content of less than 10 ppm, is then transferred to storage and then&amp;nbsp; to the clients.&lt;br&gt;The plant is organised on two production lines, line A and line B. every line can be divided in the following section:&lt;br&gt;1)&amp;nbsp; polymerisation: Every line is composed by 6 reactors of 45m3 and one reactor of 80m3 (autoclaves). The VCM is charged into the reactors by a flow metering system directly inserted on the monomer transfer line from the spherical tank storage installation to the processing plant. The catalyser is directly formed in the reactor. The filter involved in the accident is installed n this part of the plant. &lt;br&gt;2) stripping: the slurry is discharged from the reactors and stored in 250m3 tanks D25501 A/B/C/D. The gas phase of the slurry is collected by the gasometer, which functions a intermediate expansion chamber between the discontinuous process section (PVC polymerisation) and the continuous process section of the plant, which begins in the stripping section. The slurry is processed with counter current steam at approx 110°C. The 2 stripping columns C25740/750 are equipped with plates provided with holes.&lt;br&gt;3) drying: The stripped slurry at this stage is formed by approx. 30% PVC polymer and 70% water. The PVC slurry is dewatered by 2 centrifuges to a residual water content of 20 -30%. The humid resin is then transferred to the first drying stage into a flash dryer, where it is dried in hot air generated by a methane gas burner. in the second drying stage The drying process is completed in a rotating drum dryer heated with steam, and the product is finished.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;"],"LessonsLearned":["&lt;b&gt;Measures to prevent recurrence:&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;a) measures to prevent recurrence&lt;br&gt;The company declared that (annex 2):&lt;br&gt;- the accident was caused by the failure of the sealing gasket of the cap of filter P24123/B installed on the reactor feeding line B. &lt;br&gt;Possible causes of the accident:&lt;br&gt;1. defective sealing surfaces (non planar surfaces, dirty surfaces)&lt;br&gt;2. faulty tightening of the bolts after substitution of the candle filters&lt;br&gt;3. failure of the gasket employed&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Due to the fact that it is not possible to identify one single accident cause it has been decided to take preventive measures concerning all 3 potential accident causes described above:&lt;br&gt;1) refurbishment of all 4 filters P24123/A-B e P24104/B-C. &lt;br&gt;The operator has provided to grind all gasket seats of the flanges and of the candle filter bearing plate, although the inspection and tests performed on the filter did not show any defects on the sealing surfaces, this operation was performed under the supervision of ARPA Venice.&lt;br&gt;2) The tightening torque for the bolts of the flanged coupling was calculated and a procedure and regulation for the closure of filters P24123/A-B e P24104/B-C was established.&lt;br&gt;3) Modification have been performed on the equipment in order to minimise from the source pressure variations during the VCM charging process of the reactors.&lt;br&gt;4) The emergency response procedures of the department have been revised concerning the response to similar accidents. The personnel of the department has been trained concerning the emergency response and how to isolate the VCM lines in case of VCM release.&lt;br&gt;5 A study on the possibility to install a double sealing system on the filter cover is foreseen.&lt;br&gt;6) Compliance with the measures prescribed by the Occupational Health and Safety Service&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Measures to mitigate consequences: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;b) measures to mitigate consequences&lt;br&gt;After the integrated emergency response system of the establishment triggered alarm, the fire brigades of the company Servizi Porto Marghera (SPM) intervened to and took measures for the precautionary containment of the VCM by the means of water curtains. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Useful references: &lt;/b&gt;The company has presented a technical consultancy report on the impact of the VCM by Doct.

It is observed that detector Nr. 36, located a few m from the release point did not detect any VCM at 7.50.17, it is concluded therefore that the CSM release occurred between 7.50.17 hrs and 7.51.38 hrs.&lt;br&gt;Analysing the data provided by the plant operator concerning the VCM detectors and the data obtained from the Distributed Control System (DCS), like the data registered by detector FI900 (mass flow meter) or PI906 ( pressure sensor of feeding line B) there is a discrepancy with the indicated timing.&lt;br&gt;The operator declared (pag 5 annex 5) that the time indicated in the DCS is always 7 minutes and 29 seconds later than the time indicated by the sensors.&lt;br&gt;The shift assistant was informed immediately over the phone by the personnel in the control room, that the sensor system indicated the presence of VCM onsite, he came directly into the control room. Also the operative assistant came into the control room, after he was informed via intercommunication system and had ordered the entire personnel to go to the emergency gathering points foreseen by the onsite emergency response plan.&lt;br&gt;The external reactor assistant, equipped with self-respirator and a portable VCM-meter went to check the detector which triggered alarm. Successively also the shift assistant went to the release area equipped with self-respirator and reached the filter P24123/B almost contemporarily with the external assistant, there they both noticed that the filter was releasing two phase VCM from the flanged coupling in correspondence of the filter cap.&lt;br&gt;According to the reconstruction made by the operator the timing was the following:&lt;br&gt;7.52 signal from the mass spectrometer&lt;br&gt;7.54reactor assistants goes to the release point&lt;br&gt;7.55 the shift foreman goes to the release point&lt;br&gt;7.58 Closure of the manual valve upstream of the filter&lt;br&gt;7.58 Closure of the valve downstream of the filter&lt;br&gt;8.00&amp;nbsp; Start of gas relief operation&lt;br&gt;8.03 shut off operation of the valve downstream of the filter completed and connection of the filter with the gas relief line and pressure relief.&lt;br&gt;8.04 Alerting of the Operative Centre for Emergency Response of the industrial pole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The company alerted the Operative Centre for Emergency Response of the industrial pole (pag. 7 annex 5) by dialling 3333, requesting the assistance of an emergency response team to set up water curtains in order to avoid the dispersion of VCM and to abate the VCM in the area affected by the release. Afterwards the shift technician informed the fire department in Porto Marghera about the event and informed via FAX the authorities, on the starting and ending time of the emergency, as foreseen by the communication procedure of the company.&lt;br&gt;The operator ordered, consequent to the event, all department personnel not involved in the emergency response to reach the gathering points, as foreseen by the on-site emergency response plan.

They installed the water curtains using the water distribution system of the department and specific equipment they brought. The shift technician of SPM (Servizi Porto Marghera) called the security service of the chemical pole, in accordance with the emergency response procedures of the establishment, to control the vehicle movement inside the establishment and the access to the establishment itself, the shift technician also activated the message transmission system of the Site Integrated Emergency Management System.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Integrated Emergency Management System of the Site sent three messages concerning the evolution of the event.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Time of the message&lt;br&gt;8.17 PIE team in CV24 to check VCM release from the coupled flange of filter to reactors&lt;br&gt;8.18 CV24: release stopped, circuit aspiring, teams assisting&lt;br&gt;8.34 CV24: event ended, plant in safe condition&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The alarm in the department does not represent an emergency situation for the Integrated Emergency Management System.&lt;br&gt;In the report of INEOS dated 12/07/2006 (annex 5) it is stated that, apart from isolating the leaking filter the personnel responding to the emergency took the necessary measures to transfer the VCM from the filter to the abatement system.&lt;br&gt;During the operation the technicians detected the persistence of the release from the failed filter gasket, due to an incomplete emptying of the filter itself.

(registered by the mass measurement instrument) 4000kg to 7200kg&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Additional Comments:&lt;br&gt;Estimation made by the operator.&lt;br&gt;The operator estimates the amount of VCM released in 190-210 kg and the amount dsipersed into the atmosphere in 40-50 kg.&lt;br&gt;This estimation has been performed on a leak surface of 40mm2 obtained through a rectangular section of 200 mm x 0,2 mm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The operator identifies two VCM release phases&lt;br&gt;The first release phase (before the filter was isolated) lasted 8 minutes, during the first 6 minutes of this phase the VCM was released at 16 barg while for the remaining two minutes it was released at 8,5 barg.&lt;br&gt;The operator estimates that in the second phase, when the filter was isolated another 10 - 20 kg may have been released .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Determination of the released amount of VCM by flow meter FI900.&lt;br&gt;Flow meter FI900 works according to the Coriolis principle and was installed in series with respect to the failed filter, the flow regulation system and the reactors. In principle the flow meter should have registered the real amount of VCM released, due to the fact that when the accident occurred there was no charge process of the reactors of line B undergoing, and no deviation of product to other equipment was found.&lt;br&gt;The integration of the data registered by flow meter FI900 indicate (annex 7) that approx. 4000 kg of -VCM passed through the mass flow meter during a period of approx. 10 minutes.&lt;br&gt;The operator affirms (annex 5 pp15-16) that the flow registered by the instrument is not corresponding to the real one.&lt;br&gt;Concerning the potential quantity of 7200 kg it is derived from the top event \"Release of VCM from the transfer line to valve FV-9000\" (Annex 8). This accident scenario has been set up exactly in the line where the accidental release actually occurred on 06/07/2006&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"Other":["No"]}},"SubstanceClassification":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"01.

ON-SITE:&lt;br&gt;One worker was treated at the on-site medical services for cold burns caused by the exposition to VCM while responding to the event.&lt;br&gt;Additional Comments&lt;br&gt;VCM is in gaseous state at ambient temperature and pressure. VCM is maintained in liquid state by applying a higher pressure than ambient pressure. If VCM in liquid state is released into the atmosphere, because its boiling point is -13°C, the VCM partly vaporises into a cloud which can cause cold burns on the skin.&lt;br&gt;During the emergency response operation, while the worker was trying to isolate the failed filter by closing a manual valve downhill of the filter, the worker suffered a slight cold burn on his forearm caused by the contact with the handle of the manually operated valve, which was covered with ice due to the VCM release. The worker went to the onsite sanitary service for medical attention after alarm was called off.&lt;br&gt;During emergency operations, another worker suffered from a temporary sensitisation of the hand while opening the valve of the gas release system, the symptoms disappeared without any medical treatment. &lt;br&gt;The accident did not cause any off-site consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Area concerned:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The environmental monitoring system of department CV24-25 is equipped with 52 gas sampling probes, the system analyses the presence of VCM (vinyl chloride monomer), ECF (ethyl chloroformate) and DCE (di-chloro-ethane), this has allowed to detect the VCM release in the area affected and the evolution of the VCM concentrations.&lt;br&gt;The streams extracted by each sampling probe is sent to a mass spectrograph to determine the concentrations, the systems allows to detect concentrations from 0 to 100 ppm.&lt;br&gt;The VCM monitoring is performed each 17 minutes, between each extraction of air samples by the sampling probes and the successive extraction, the analysis sequence is not numeric. The VCM release point is located inside a shed with three walls, partially opened to the exterior. The filter is located on a second floor some 8-10 m from the ground. On the ground floor are located polymerisation lines A and B constituted by a total of 14 reactors.&lt;br&gt;The records of the values measured by each probe the day of the event (annex 4), show that during an extended period of time inside the shed. VCM concentrations reached values of more than 100 ppm (above the measurement limit of the instruments), probably due to the fact that the shed is only partially opened.&lt;br&gt;In the polymerisation area a value above instrument measurement limit was measured at 7.51.38 by probe 30 (bottom of reactors 7 and 8) while probe Nr. 19 (comb of reactor 14) measured values above 100 ppm. also after 9.30 hrs. Probe Nr. 36 located near the release point registered VCM concentrations in the air above 100 ppm. Untill approx. 10.15. After that hour there are no records of VCM concentrations measured by the probes above 100 ppm.&lt;br&gt;Also outside the polymerisation area there are some probes which registered VCM concentrations above 100 ppm: in particular probes 6 and 63 registered concentration peaks of VCM respectively at 8.15.14 and 8.09.06 in correspondence of road F located south- west from the release point, the measured values descended to 10 ppm respectively at&amp;nbsp; 8.49.59 and 8.27.00.&lt;br&gt;The probe located the farthest from the release point measured relevant concentrations of VCM, probe Nr. 61, located in correspondence to the gasholder some 120 m from the release point, measured a VCM concentration of 74.34 ppm. at 8.07.47 hrs, while the foregoing measurement and the successive one registered just CVM concentrations below 1 ppm.&lt;br&gt;Also probe Nr. 44 inside the control room detected a VCM concentration of 93.28 ppm at 8.11.42 and then progressively decreasing values until values below 1 ppm.&lt;br&gt;Ineos Vinyl has employed a mobile vehicle to monitor the VCM concentrations in the areas outside of the departments (annex 5 page 20)&lt;br&gt;The mobile vehicle performed 28 progressive measurements at 12 minutes interval in relation to 9 different positions, of which 8 were inside a perimeter of 500 metres from the department and one measurement point was located between 00 and 1000 m from the department. The values measured by the mobile vehicle were in the range of a few ppm while inside the department the values measured were above 100 ppm.&lt;br&gt;The position nearest to the city, monitored by the mobile vehicle, was position Nr. 7, the values were of 0,19 ppm and 0,8 ppm measured respectively at 11.34 and 11.46.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;People - Remarks:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the event occurred the shift personnel present insite was composed by:&lt;br&gt;Shift personnel Position&lt;br&gt;1 shift assistant in the office building&lt;br&gt;3 switchboard operators in the control room&lt;br&gt;1 external reactor operator in the control room&lt;br&gt;1 external services operator in the control room&lt;br&gt;1 external drying process operator in the office of the shift assistant&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The day shift personnel starts work at 8:00 hrs. When the event occurred there was the following personnel present onsite.&lt;br&gt;Day shift personnel Position&lt;br&gt;1 plant assistant in the office building&lt;br&gt;1 operation assistant in the office building&lt;br&gt;1 plant maintenance assistant in the office building&lt;br&gt;4 department maintenance assistants in the office building&lt;br&gt;1 department safety assistant in the office building&lt;br&gt;8 employees with the function \"maintenance and engineering\" in the office building&lt;br&gt;1 SHE manger in the office building&lt;br&gt;4 personnel of external contractors in the office building&lt;br&gt;5 personnel members with the function of \"electric instrument maintenance\" in the electric instrument maintenance workshop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Non hospitalised injured persons.&lt;br&gt;None of the persons present in the department or nearby areas was directly exposed to VCM, nor has presented symptoms relatable to the event.&lt;br&gt;During all phases related to the emergency response, individual protective equipment with self respirators was employed. Self protective equipment with facial mask and specific AX filter or ABEK filter (annex 5 page 7)&lt;br&gt;The company has presented a technical consultancy report on the impact of the VCM release made by Doct. Tommaso A. Dragani in which it is stated that: \"The VCM release on 6/07/2006 never constituted a health hazard\".&lt;br&gt;During the emergency response operation a worker, while trying to isolate the failed filter by closing a manual valve downhill of the filter, suffered a slight cold burn on his forearm caused by the contact with the handle of the manually operated valve, which was covered with ice due to the VCM release. The worker went to the onsite sanitary service for medical attention after alarm was called off.&lt;br&gt;During emergency operations, another worker suffered from a temporary sensitisation of one hand while opening the valve of the gas relief system, the symptoms disappeared without any medical treatment. &lt;br&gt;There are no known offsite consequences to persons or known offsite material damage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ecological Harm - Remarks:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;On 06/07/2006 at 14.07 hrs a water samples were taken from the sewage water discharged into the public sewage system at point SM2. The analysis made by the Societa Servizi Porto Marghera (SPM) indicates a concentration of 22,4 g/l of VCM, with respect to the threshold limit of 50 g/l.&lt;br&gt;Test report 2006/5852 on a former test sample taken at 8:20 indicates a VCM concentration of 3.1 g/l.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"Human":[1],"Environmental":[0],"Cost":[0],"Disruption":[0]},"HumanOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","Effect":"Establishment Population: 33","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"HumanOffSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","Effect":"Emergency Personnel : 4","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"DetailHumanOffSite":{},"DetailHumanOnSite":{},"DetailHumanEmergency":{},"EnvironmentalOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"inland: metropolitan development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"inland: urban development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"inland: rural development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"inland: parkland/commonland","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"inland: grassland/pasture/meadow","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"inland: arable land/crops/vineyards/orchards","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"inland: woodland;
