The off-site competent authorities were alerted. The off-site emergency plan was set off by the prefecture of Ancona. Concerning the off-site emergency plan it can be noted that its activation had mainly a precautionary purpose, because the impact area of the accident did not affect, according to evidence, either the railway line (during the first phase of the accident before train circulation had been stopped two trains had passed), or the Flaminia road adjacent to the establishment.&lt;br&gt;As a precautionary measure the military authority ordered the evacuation of barracks located near the establishment.&lt;br&gt;The roofs of tanks TK231 and TK232, affected by the fire, were kept safe under a protective layer of extinguishing foam deposited on top of the roofs after the fire had been extinguished &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emergency measures - Remarks:&lt;b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Concerning the emergency measures taken off-site, the population was alerted (ref 7302) over a loudspeaker system, installed in adequate locations in the town of Falconara, by the municipality of Falconara in common agreement with the establishment specifically for emergencies occurring in the refinery.\nThe measures still necessary at the time of the inspection consisted substantially in maintaining a cover of extinguishing foam on the roofs of the storage tanks involved in the fire (see short report).\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Official action taken - legal action: &lt;br&gt;An investigation is being carried out by the State Attorneys Office. The judicial seizure of the equipment and plants involved in the accident was ordered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Official action taken - other official action: &lt;br&gt;Following the accident a special meeting of the competent regional technical committee was organised as foreseen by decrees implementing the Seveso Directive in Italian law.  During the meeting, after having evaluated the gravity of the accident, a series of safety measures to be adopted by the establishment in the short and medium term were identified. These included the delocalisation of the gasoline storage tanks nearest to the railway track and the public roads towards the area near the shore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seveso II duties  - remarks: &lt;br&gt;Concerning points C and D, it has\nbeen decided to maintain the default indication NO. This choice has\nbeen made because an official inspection ordered by the Minister of the\nEnvironment (in compliance with art 18 of Directive 96/82/EU) is being\ncarried out with the specific goal to verify the implementation by the\nestablishment management of the Safety Management System with regards\nto the prevention of major accidents. During the follow up of to the\ninspection it will be mandatory to consider the consequences of the\naccident that occurred.

In the electrical substation a partition wall collapsed, while the other walls were fissured and electrical appliances were damaged. Damage due to the fire was also found in the roofs of the nearest diesel loading platforms. &lt;br&gt;As a precautionary measure the prefect ordered the interruption of traffic on the \"Flaminia\" main road running along the refinery and the Ancona - Bologna railway running through the establishment. The activity of the nearby Raffaello-Sanzio airport was interrupted, both because the fire combustion cloud could have affected the landing and take-off paths of the airplanes and because the airport fire fighters were participating in the emergency response operations at the refinery with specialised equipment taken from the airport.&lt;br&gt;The cloud caused by the fire, containing hydrocarbon combustion products was seen by the population of Falconara. The explosions consequent to the fire were heard by a part of the population of Falconara Marittima, which is located at a certain distance from the refinery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Affected Area: installation&lt;br&gt;Affected Area: establishment&lt;br&gt;"],"Human":[1],"Environmental":[0],"Cost":[1],"Disruption":[1]},"HumanOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","Effect":"Establishment Population: 38","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","Quantity":2,"Effect":"On Site Fatalities: 2","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"HumanOffSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","Effect":"Emergency Personnel : 8","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","Effect":"Emergency Personnel : 2","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"DetailHumanOffSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Establishment total at risk","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"immediate fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"subsequent fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"hospitalizing injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other serious injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"health monitoring","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true}],"DetailHumanOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Establishment total at risk","Quantity":38,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"immediate fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"subsequent fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"hospitalizing injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other serious injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"health monitoring","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true}],"DetailHumanEmergency":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Establishment total at risk","Quantity":8,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"immediate fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"subsequent fatalities","Quantity":2,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"hospitalizing injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other serious injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"health monitoring","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true}],"EnvironmentalOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"inland: metropolitan development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"inland: urban development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"inland: rural development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"inland: parkland/commonland","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"inland: grassland/pasture/meadow","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"inland: arable land/crops/vineyards/orchards","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"inland: woodland;
