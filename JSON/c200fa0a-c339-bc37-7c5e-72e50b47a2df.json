The first attempt of the firemen was to isolate the ammonium nitrate in compartment No 5 from the No 2 involved in the fire by means of water curtains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:&lt;br&gt;When the toxicity danger due to smoke cloud became evident, preparations for the evacuation of an area affecting about 73,000 people started. At the same time, the number of fire fighting equipments was increased involving all the nearby safety centres and continuous monitoring of cloud movements by means of a helicopter and metereological indications given by the Nantes station were carried out. The rail traffic between Nantes Le Croisis and Redon had been interrupted and preparation for evacuation in a radius of 1 km started. Nitric acid concentrations of 5ppm were measured by the Nantes cell up to Coueron. The requisition of all public transport vehicles was made. A request to the army for assistance with vehicles was made. The Mobile Chemical Action Cell of Angers was asked for help and for a reserve of isolating respirators. The ORSEC plan was activated and the decision to evacuate was made. Public was notified by radio and by vehicles with loudspeakers. Schools, dance halls, sports hall were made available for receiving the evacuated people. During this period of time the products on fire were soaked with a total flow of 700m3/h. The fire was almost extinguished at 14:15 but emission of smoke was reduced considerably at 16:00.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Emergency measures - Remarks: The first reaction of the personnel was to use, unsuccessfully, portable fire extinguishers until the fire brigade intervened (code 7107). At 09:43 a 3 vehicle team arrived on-site and immediately requested a reinforcement with foam equipments (codes 7201 and 7103). The first attempt of the firemen was to isolate the ammonium nitrate in compartment No 5 by means of water curtains (code 7102). At 10:30 the toxicity danger due to smoke cloud became evident and at 11:15 preparations for the evacuation of an area affecting about 73,000 people started. At the same time, the number of fire fighting equipments was increased involving all the nearby safety centres (code 7201) and continuous monitoring of cloud movements by means of a helicopter (code 7203) and meteorological indications given by the Nantes station were carried out (code 7109). At 11:30 the rail traffic between Nantes Le Croisis and Redon had been interrupted (code 7208) and preparation for evacuation in a radius of 1 km started. At 13:00 nitric acid concentrations of 5ppm were measured by the Nantes cell up to Coueron (code 7109). The requisition of all public transport vehicles was made. At 13:50 a request to the army for assistance with vehicles was made (code 7204). At 14:00 the Mobile Chemical Action Cell of Angers was asked for help and for a reserve of isolating respirators (code 7201). At 14:15 the ORSEC plan was activated (code 7200) and at 14:30 the decision to evacuate was made (code7402). Public was notified by radio and by vehicles with loudspeakers (codes 7301 and 7302).

The fire was almost extinguished at 14:15 but emission of smoke was reduced considerably at 16:00. The rail traffic was resumed at 19:00 and population allowed to return home at 22:00 (code 7404). At 02:34 firemen penetrated inside the store and at 05:00 the fire was considered as extinguished.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discussion about response: At 08:00 four people started to work in the storage installation and, at 08:30, everything was normal. Some smoke was noticed by the storage personnel at about 09:15 am. The first reaction of the personnel was to use, unsuccessfully, portable fire extinguishers until the fire brigade intervened even if visible fire was never noticed. At 09:43 a 3 vehicle team arrived on-site and, after assessment of the situation, immediately requested a reinforcement with foam equipments. Fire fighting operations proceeded with difficulty owing to the yellow/red smoke cloud which had developed. The first attempt of the firemen was to isolate the ammonium nitrate in compartment No 5 from the compartment involved in the fire by means of water curtains. At 10:30 the toxicity danger due to smoke cloud became evident and at 11:15 preparations for the evacuation of an area affecting about 73,000 people started (shelter information to the public by vehicles with loudspeakers, telephone calls to town halls and through TV and local radio stations). At the same time, the number of fire fighting equipments was increased involving all the nearby safety centres and continuous monitoring of cloud movements by means of a helicopter and metereological indications given by the Nantes station were carried out (the concentrations of main pollutants [nitric acid, nitrogen oxides and ammonia] inside and outside the storehouse and at nearby communities as a function of time are available in the Original Report and the in relevant presentation in the Seminar on \"The Notification of Major Accidents\" held at Rethymnon Greece on October 6/7 in 1988). The toxic cloud reached an height of about 250m and was 5km large and it was covering a surface of about 15 km.

These defective cables (due to their age and the oversizing of the fuses and circuit breakers) caused the fertilizers decomposition; the short duration in which electrical current flew should be pointed out (switch-on at about 09:00 and detection of smoke and switch-off at about 09:15). On the other hand, the short-circuit assumption must be discarded because people worked until they were switched off and, besides, no blown fuse was found and the heat generated by a short-circuit is generally insufficient to initiate decomposition;\n&lt;br&gt;d) wooden pallets in contact with the fertilizers compounds which caught fire during decomposition and released heat which accelerated the decomposition;\n&lt;br&gt;e) the absence of any efficient fire-fighting means. If there had been a massive quantity of water rapidly available to put out the fire, the decomposition could have been slowed down before to develop out of control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"Other":["Yes"]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["36923538-eabb-7efb-695e-64ee0914b581"],"Consequence_Description":["EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:&lt;br&gt;Internal to the establishment, 29 people were injured by the accident (25 by the toxic release and 4 by the fire).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MATERIAL LOSS:&lt;br&gt;The storage installation was damaged by the fire but no data are available about the cost of the material damages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ECOLOGICAL HARM:&lt;br&gt;During the main fire fighting attempt, products on fire were drenched under a water flow rate of 700m3/h. The contaminated fire fighting water caused a slight pollution of the La Loire river.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:&lt;br&gt;When the toxicity danger due to smoke cloud became evident, preparations for the evacuation of an area affecting about 73,000 people started, but, about 5 hours after the smoke began to appear, it was necessary to evacuate only 25,000 people. The rail traffic between Nantes Le Croisis and Redon had been interrupted and preparation for evacuation in a radius of 1 km started. The requisition of all public transport vehicles was made. The ORSEC plan was activated and the decision to evacuate was made. Public was notified by radio and by vehicles with loudspeakers. Schools, dance halls, sports hall were made available for receiving the evacuated people. Public was informed by vehicles with loudspeakers, telephone calls to town halls and through TV and local radio stations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discussion of consequences: At 15:30, the maximum concentrations measured inside the installation were: nitric acid = 50ppm; nitrogen oxides = 5 ppm; chlorine = 3ppm. At 22:00 there were: nitric acid = 15ppm; nitrogen oxides = 5 ppm; chlorine = less 0.3ppm. At 02:45 there were: nitric acid = 0ppm; nitrogen oxides = 1 ppm; chlorine = 0.2ppm. Outside the installation, at 15:30 there were: nitric acid = 5ppm; nitrogen oxides = 0.2 ppm. At 22:00 there were 5ppm of nitric acid. Ammonia was not detected, both inside and outside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Affected Area: installation&lt;br&gt;Affected Area: establishment&lt;br&gt;Affected Area: off-site: local&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Consequences - Ecological harm - pollution/contamination/damage of : &lt;br&gt;
