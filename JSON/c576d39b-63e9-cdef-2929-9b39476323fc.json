This phase was carried out from 27/09/2005 to 30/09/2005 in the morning. &lt;br&gt;On September 30, 2005 one of the the shifts has started the morning shift. The shift leader assigned his workers to different jobs and establishments at the start of the shift. The plant manager starting to work at 7.30 a.m., after getting preliminary information, instructed shift leader&amp;nbsp; to carry out the mechanical works at storage tank HF3 as a task of priority.&lt;br&gt;Discussing the manpower need for this job, plant manager told to shut down the mono-nitrating plant and after finishing-off the ongoing charge, also the shutdown of fluorination plant no. 2 and he was of opinion that the manpower released in this way would be sufficient for the execution of the task. &lt;br&gt;Shift leader, after the decision made by the plant manager, had the mono-nitrating plant shut down. He first sent the workers from there to the foreman to pick up tools and special protective equipment and then the workers had to contact plant manager for further assignments. &lt;br&gt;Shift leader did not clearly interpret the instructions he received from the plant manager with regard to the operation of fluorination plant no.2, because he has dismissed one of the operators from there and sent him to help with the mechanical works and he did not give clear instructions to the other operator to start a new charge or to stop the operation either. &lt;br&gt;The preparations of the mechanical works related to tank HF3 came to an end at about 8 o'clock. Mechanical works started under the on-site supervision and management of plant manager. Neither the plant manager, nor the workers actually involved in the works deemed it necessary to wear special protective equipment. &lt;br&gt;Simultaneously with the mechanical works the actual process steps of the charge introduced in the night shift at the fluorination plant were going on. &lt;br&gt;Upon the completion of those steps the operator of fluorination plant no. 2 has started to feed a new charge with HF feed, as he interpreted the instructions given by the plant manager that the plant did not need to be shut down, he was only instructed to pay more attention during the handling of the HF-valves.&lt;br&gt;At about 9.00 o'clock a.m 3 works from the team carrying out the mechanical works have started to relocate a pipeline section (about 6 m long) dismantled earlier. The later victim held one end of this pipeline section in his hands. During lifting he was at the free nozzle that was connected to the HF measurement off-gas pipeline of the 2nd fluorination plant. &lt;br&gt;Probably the operator of the fluorination plant no. 2 has finished the feed of HF from the measuring drum and has started the depressurization of the space inside of the drum by that time.&lt;br&gt;Gases saturated with HF released trough the free nozzle have contacted the face and the upper body of the later victim. &lt;br&gt;After recognizing the accident his colleagues have immediately escorted the injured to the emergency shower close to the scene, where they have showered his upper body and then at the first-aid point on the 1st floor they washed off the injured body part with Ca-lactate solution. &lt;br&gt;Then they have transported the worker to the emergency room of the company doctor by forklift truck. &lt;br&gt;The call center operator, on the basis of the information received from the shift leader, informed the paramedics at 9.05 who transported the injured at 9.30 from the territory of BV Rt. into the hospital. &lt;br&gt;The plant manager being close to the scene when recognizing the accident has blocked the open off-gas valve of the HF measuring drum at fluorination plant no. 2. With this movement the release of gases saturated with HF through the free pipe nozzle into the atmosphere was terminated. &lt;br&gt;Note: at a distance of about 0.5 m from the pipe end, in the same off-gas pipeline, there is a shut-off valve that was, on the basis of the information received from the plant manager in the course of the on-site inspection, not blocked in the moment when the accident happened and it was the plant manager who has blocked it after the accident. &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;

He assigned the other operator to the further operation and he did not describe the assignment in detail. &lt;br&gt;The operator at the fluorination plant no. 2 understood from the instructions of the shift leader that he would not only have to finish the ongoing charge, but he could start feeding a new charge as well. &lt;br&gt;/At that time the operator of fluorination plant no. 2 was only a kind of supervision, therefore, for this activity, even one person would have been sufficient. However, for the feeding of a new charge, in case of the operation of one plant, two persons shall be assigned according to the work instructions./&lt;br&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; At fluorination plant no.2 there was only one person carrying out the feed of the new charge, though the operator should have known on the basis of the work instructions that in case of the operation of a plant 2 people shall be assigned to this activity. &lt;br&gt;6.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Deficiencies of the risk assessment.&lt;br&gt;Hazards associated to the handling of HF were not covered
