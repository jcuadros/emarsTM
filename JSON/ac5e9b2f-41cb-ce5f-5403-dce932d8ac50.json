For example, shortening the old outfall and remaking a diffuser cost&amp;nbsp; 329,300 # excluding VAT, and setting up the new discharge point has been estimated at 5,500,000 #. For economic reasons, this work had to be done as temporary replacement of the new pipe between the Le Havre plant and Hode and would never have been undertaken if the new pipe had been operational from the 3rd quarter 2002.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Organisational aspects&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The operator's HSE management system required improvements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"],"EmergencyResponce_Descr":["&lt;p&gt;Problems encountered by the plant in operating its new pipe turned out to be far more serious than anticipated and the operator was not anticipating starting the pipe up again before September 2003.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the 13 August 2002 emergency measure order expired on 13 September 2002, the operator asked for it to be extended to December 2002. A further emergency measure order proposed by the DRIRE was signed by the Prefect on 17 September 2002:&lt;br&gt;- It took into account the actual characteristics of the effluent, which resulted in an increase in the flow discharged (maximum average flow over 24 h equal to 14,760 m3/d) and the distance at which the pH is over 5.5 being extended from 50 m to 80 m;&lt;br&gt;- It provided for an investigation into the installation of a new emergency, temporary outfall to discharge into Seine Bay, so as to enable investigations to continue on the pipe between the Le Havre site and Hode without affecting progress on work to redevelop the port.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Up to 31 December 2002, the operator thus discharged its effluent into the Seine, via the old outfall (used before the pipe between the Le Havre site and Hode came into operation) partly isolating it from the work to extend the port of the Le Havre. As the new pipe between the Le Havre plant and the Hode neutralisation unit could not be operated again before the end of the 3rd quarter 2003, as an intermediate solution the operator confirmed the building of the new outfall. Various procedures under the regulations lead to temporary approval of:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Firstly the discharge of effluent into the Seine estuary,&lt;br&gt;- Secondly the alteration of the point of discharge into Seine Bay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The operator thus had to stop discharging into Seine Bay up to 2 January 2004 and bring the pipe between the Le Havre plant and the Hode neutralisation unit back into operation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, as there had been a number of incidents at the site in a few months, the 21 October 2002 Prefect's emergency measures order specified an audit of its Health, Safety and Environment management system in order to ensure that it was adequate and functioning correctly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly, the Prefect signed an order on 12 December 2002 requiring a review of all hazard surveys relative to the Le Havre site. This was because the last hazard surveys undertaken were specific to certain units and were more than five years old. In view of the various incidents that had occurred at the site, it appeared necessary to take stock of all hazards at the site and not just at some units.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Technically speaking, the operator has replaced all leaking pipes. On 22 July 2003, the pipe successfully underwent a further test with water at a pressure of 15 bars maintained for 2 hours. Tests with acidic water were conducted from early August 2003, two other pipes at high points were damaged and have been repaired. In November 2003, the plant was stopped as the acid production unit was being serviced. New trials are scheduled for when acid effluent is available again.&lt;br&gt;Finally, an additional order by the Prefect was made on 8 March 2004. It requires a new transport pipe to be brought into operation before 30 June 2006. It will follow the route of the old pipe and will be made or high density poly-ethylene (HDPE), not LFG.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"],"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["6799492a-0079-4d05-aad1-8f4dce857337"],"LastUser":{"UserId":["6799492a-0079-4d05-aad1-8f4dce857337"],"Name":["Enrico"],"Surname":["GUAGNINI"],"IsVisibleSensibleData":[false]},"LastDate":["2019-12-12T10:37:20.277"],"ParentCompany":{},"Region":{},"Province":{},"City":{},"PostCode":{},"Concurrency":[0]},"LockedUserId":{},"LockedDate":{},"IsLocked":[false],"IsLockedByMe":[false],"LockedUser":{}},"AccidentProfile_Tab":{"ReportingAuthority":{},"ContactPerson":{},"Reasons":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Substances involved: greater than 5% of quantity in Column 3 of Annex I"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Injury to persons: &gt;= 1 fatalities, &gt;= 6 hospitalizing injuries etc."},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Immediate damage to the environment (according to Annex VI)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Damage to property: on-site &gt;2M &amp;euro;, off-site &gt; 0.5M &amp;euro;"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"Cross-border damage: transboundary accidents"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"Interesting for lessons learned."}],"AffectedCountries":{}},"AccidentDescription_Tab":{"AccidentDescription":{"DominoEffects":[false],"NatechEvents":[false],"TransboundaryEffects":[false],"Contractors":[false],"accTypeRelease":[0],"accTypeFire":[0],"accTypeExplosion":[0],"accTypeTransport":[0],"accTypeOther":{},"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["6799492a-0079-4d05-aad1-8f4dce857337"],"LastDate":["2019-12-12T10:37:20.277"],"Concurrency":[0],"Translation":{"VersionId":["db0c8aba-cc68-479b-8ead-1d749b24e363"],"LanguageId":["EN"],"AccidentDescription":["&lt;p&gt;Discharge of acid substances from an industrial process following the failure of a transfer pipe between the site and the discharge point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The accident can be classified in the OECD framework (off-site transfer pipe). However, as the pipe belongs to a Low Threshold Seveso site, it was notified under MARS as an \"other event\".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The event was classified level 3 of the scale, as published in February 1994 by the Committee of Competent Authorities for the implementation of the Seveso directive (cost of repairs in excess of 5.8 Meuros).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The accident:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; On 7 August 2002 at 12.01 a.m., the pipe monitoring system (line balance) detected a leak of 100 m3/h (out of a nominal flow of 500 m3/h) of secondary water (dilute sulphuric acid: concentration less than or equal to 15 g/l of sulphate), at a pressure of 5 bars. An inspection was made by the operator on the ground and in all ducts over the whole route of the pipe in order to identify the leak. Assessed at about 20 m3, the leak was due to fissuring on 40 cm of a pipe within the boundaries of the Le Havre plant. After the faulty section had been replaced, the whole of the pipe was tested again and the facility returned to operation.&lt;br&gt; Four days later, on Sunday 11 August 2002 at 8.05 p.m. a new leak occurred which the monitoring system at once detected. The nominal flow was then 440 m3/h (dilute sulphuric acid), at a pressure of 3.9 bars (these conditions are however lower than the maximum running conditions and lower still than the test conditions). The leak was located outside the Le Havre plant, in an underground part of the pipeline, close to where it runs under a railway line behind the LPG storage and filling centre. The leak was assessed at between 100 and 200 m3.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; In total, between 5 August and 11 August 2002, eight defects were found, six of them on the first two kilometres of pipe. Two defects occurred during operation, under similar conditions, near to bends and at changes of direction, yet this pipeline had only run a few dozen hours under operating conditions where the pressure had never exceeded 5 bars in a dilute sulphuric acid environment (concentration less than 15g/l) and at a temperature of under 35°C (temperature allowed for LFG pipes 50°C).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; As from 11 August 2002, the pipe was shut down for generic failure. Experts were appointed by both the owner and the operator in order to determine the reasons for the failure of the pipe. In November 2002 and January 2003, leak detection tests using a mixture of nitrogen + helium revealed two further leaks.&lt;/p&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;

tier and employs about 420 people at the site.&lt;br&gt;It mainly produces titanium dioxide, used as a pigment in numerous sectors (paper, rubber, ceramics, plastics, paint, ink as well as pharmaceuticals and cosmetics). The production capacity of the Le Havre site is about 95,000 tonnes/year. Titanium dioxide can be produced industrially either by the chlorine process, or by the sulphate process. The sulphate process is used for production at Le Havre.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"Installation_Description":["&lt;p&gt;The manufacture of titanium oxide starts from a blend of natural mineral (ilmenite) and steelworks slag that contains a variable quantity of TiO2. The process can be summarised as a succession of operations that enable it to be extracted and then purified.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Treating these minerals with sulphuric acid (also made at the site) generates acid effluent. Part of the acid process water (the most acidic, known as \"primary water\") is carried, via an 18 km long pipe (DN300 mm), to the Hode site to be treated, before being discharged into the Seine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other part of the acidic water (named \"secondary water\", at a rate of about 14,700 m3/d) was discharged via a diffuser into Seine Bay, without special treatment. The operator was intending, from 31 July 2002, to send its water to the Hode neutralisation station, via a second 18 km pipe made of LFG (laminated fibreglass) installed in 2001-2002 (DN 400 mm LFG pipe).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both pipes carrying acidic water are installations connected to classified facilities but are also covered by the 6 December 1982 ministerial order setting out technical regulations for pipes carrying fluids under pressure other than hydrocarbons and combustible gases. In this respect, the 3 September 2001 prefect's order authorising the extension of the Hode facilities imposes on the operator specific requirements for installing and operating the DN 400 LFG pipe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The DN 400 LFG pipe was installed in accordance with the technical provisions required by the 6 December 1982 order, namely, pipework appropriate to running conditions (type of fluid, temperature and pressure) and assemblies correctly performed and inspected. The pipe, for which the calculation pressure is 10 bar (for a working pressure of about 4 bar) successfully passed the water pressure test at 15 bar on 16 July 2002.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On 31 July 2002, in accordance with the Prefect's 3 September 2001 approval, the discharge into Seine Bay of \"slightly acid\" effluent was stopped and the effluent was sent to Hode in the new pipe, from the

Stress corrosion is a fissuring mechanism that requires a combination of the following three factors:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- A stress (or permanent distortion),&lt;br&gt;- A material sensitive to the phenomenon,&lt;br&gt;- A corrosive environment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of the basic data for the pipeline specification was analysed by experts appointed subsequent to the failures in the pipe. The investigation produced several findings:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Soil / structure interaction &lt;br&gt;As regards the soil, the specification for the pipe required minimum compacting for the bed and sides. Now soil tests made around the pipeline showed compacting values lower than those specified. The pipe thus became more oval in places than the maximum acceptable value.&lt;br&gt;- Hydraulic specification &lt;br&gt;In order to protect the pipeline both from excess pressure (water hammer on start-up) and from negative pressure (pumping stop / start stage), a 20 m3 water hammer protection chamber was installed at the start of the line. To be effective, it was specified that the chamber should be pre-pressurised at 0.5 bar; now on testing following the various incidents, it was found that the chamber had been ore-pressurised at 1.7 bar. The whole of the pipeline thus suffered a more violent pressure drop when pumping stopped (the greatest negative pressure having occurred in the first two kilometres). Similarly, the potential existence of air at high points, because of the absence of vents at the highest points, could have had the same hydraulic consequences, from both excess pressure and negative pressure. &lt;br&gt;- Life of composite pipelines &lt;br&gt;The design curve for the pipeline as regards the risk from stress corrosion supplemented with some experimental values in the field of substantial distortion shows that the burst-time for composite pipelines is a few dozen hours for substantial distortions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The failures occurred near to or at high points and close to a change of direction, which confirms the role of hydraulic transitions. Some failures occurred in a zone where it is difficult to have correct soil compacting (pipeline near to the water table and concrete bore holes). Lastly, most of the failures (6 out of 8) occurred in the first two kilometres, which is the area where hydraulic forces are highest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"],"Other":["Yes"]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","CauseType":{"Type_ID":1,"Category":"all","Description":"none"},"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["db0c8aba-cc68-479b-8ead-1d749b24e363"],"Consequence_Description":["All soil polluted by the various leaks was treated with sodium carbonate and used as backfill for trenches.
