Investigations on the other 2 tanks&amp;nbsp; excluded the presence of passing-through holes. The 4th tank was already equipped with a double bottom since 2013. It is not plausible the involving of sewage networks and drainage as a cause of contamination, because following surveys carried out by the operator had not reported damage in the waste water sewerage system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b) Failure of the secondary protection system: damage to the asphalt sheath resulting in cracking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The causes that favored vertical migration into the underlying layers of the tank bottom are due to the probable damage to the waterproof layer consisting of a bituminous conglomerate for a thickness of about 80 mm&amp;nbsp;below this. Non-destructive investigations carried out with the georadar probe during the installation of double bottoms on the tank led the operator to exclude&amp;nbsp;voids below the foundation, although it should be considered that this instrumentation does not allow to identify cracks in the size&lt;br&gt;of the order of mm. It is very likely that such cracks&amp;nbsp;had been generated by&amp;nbsp; the contact&amp;nbsp; of two materials with different behavior at stresses (bituminous layer with less rigid behavior in contact&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;rigid concrete foundation).&lt;br&gt;Probably the bituminous conglomerate of low strength, subjected to the continuous vertical pressures of the product at the bottom of the tank (variable depending on the degree of filling) tends to deform and break at the contact with the&amp;nbsp; harder concrete foundation, causing detachment of the asphalt layer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;c) &lt;strong&gt;Failure of alarm systems to prevent and / or mitigate the event and to signal the&amp;nbsp;uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The containment losses of primary and secondary protection systems allowed the vertical migration of crude oil into the underlying layers of bituminous conglomerate consisting of honeycomb and compacted hollow mix of thickness of 1 meter and 2 meters respectively.&lt;br&gt;The vertical migration of the crude oil proceeds from the unsaturated zone to the saturated one&amp;nbsp; (aquifer) until it reaches the groundwater table at about 5-6 meters in depth. Subsequently, the presence below the tank of a preferential horizontal drainage pathway of groundwater, consisting of the presence of an intubated and underground tract of a paleo-ditch favored the drainage and rapid migration of the hydrocarbon plume into separate phase in the southwest direction.&lt;br&gt;The event was verified on 3 February 2017 when the extent of contamination had already reached the areas outside of the plant.&lt;/p&gt;"],"Other":{}}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment
