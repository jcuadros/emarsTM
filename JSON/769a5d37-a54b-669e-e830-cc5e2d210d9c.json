The night guardian passed a check-point behind storage tank No 31 at 04:00 am and did not notice anything abnormal. At 04:00 am 2 employees arrived in the office company (it is situated about 250 m from the parking lot for lorries). A few minutes after their arrival 5 valves on the tanks' bottom were activated including tanks No 30 and 31. At 04:10, a driver from the parking lot passed by the office to warn about a petrol smelling mist on the parking place. The two employees check this phenomenon (moving around in car!) first at the parking place and then inside the establishment. At 04:20 the 2 men observed a mist whiter than fog at the east counterfort of the tank No 22 and inside the retention basin of tanks No 30 and 31. None of the other retention basins contained any mist. The mist entered the parking lot passing under the counterfort separating the retention basin from the parking lot. The mist covered the whole parking area and was just about reaching the road. At 04:20 am a violent explosion happened originating from the parking place and propagating towards the storage area. The two employees were thrown in the retention basin by the shock wave, but managed to return to the office and close the automatic valves. The emergency services arrived on-site at 04:38 am. The police blocked the access to the roads around the storage facility, and the railway traffic was interrupted. The tanks caught fire at 04:50 am. The fire was extinguished at 12.17.
