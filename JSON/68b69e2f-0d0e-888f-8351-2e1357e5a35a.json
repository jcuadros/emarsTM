The plant superintendent determined the quantities of solvent, monomer and initiator needed for the reaction, which initially was not particularly vigorous. Several minutes later, the senior operator heard a loud hissing and saw vapor venting from the reactor manway, which forced him out of the building. He returned with a respirator and was able to start emergency cooling water flow to the jacket. However, the building exploded 30 seconds after he left.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Investigations after the accident revealed that there were several causes that led to the runaway reaction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The company did not perform hazard identification of their processes. No formal hazard review had been conducted to address what could go wrong during reactor operations. The company had minimal safety information on its polymerization processes, even though this was the core of its manufacturing business. Product formulations were optimized to meet customer specifications. However, reaction characterization and calorimetry were not performed to establish process equipment performance requirements. Indeed, calorimetry experiments performed after the accident proved that the modifications on the recipe generated a heat output that was 2.3 times that of the original recipe, clearly exceeding the heat removal capacity of the condenser and the emergency jacket cooling of the reactor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- When scaling-up new products from the laboratory, previous plant managers had typically estimated initial production batch sizes based on past experience, or with simple trial-and-error systems. Batch quantities were gradually increased until the sight glass in the condensate return line showed that the condenser was too close to flooding, or that another performance limit, like the reactor pressure increase, was being approached. The condenser's cooling capacity was not documented, nor could the cooling load be determined with the available instrumentation. As a result, information essential to the safe operation of the reactor was not available.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Most of the management and operations personnel had been on the job less than one year (in some cases much less) and lacked previous polymer manufacturing experience. Personnel, including site managers, were thus poorly prepared to recognize potentially hazardous changes to product recipes, or to respond to an incipient runaway reaction. Additionally, the company had no chemical or other engineer on staff, and none had been contracted to evaluate the hazards associated with reactive operations at the site.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Based on the accident investigation, it turned out that the employees and managers had little or no understanding of reactive hazards. They had not been trained on, and did not understand, the safety margin of safety needed or available in their polymerization operations. Furthermore, they had little knowledge of the sensitivity of the reactor to changes in product recipes, batch sizes or reaction conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The company relied primarily on a procedural safeguard to prevent loss of reactor control: the batch sheet, which was used as an operating procedure at the site. But additional process safeguards, necessary when coping with the effects of runaway reactions, where totally missing in the reactor set-up. Examples of systems that could have helped to prevent or mitigate the accident are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - high pressure alarm systems.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - automatic emergency cooling water to the reactor jacket.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - automatic shut-off of initiator feed.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - automatic injection of \"short stop\" solution to stop the polymerization reaction.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - automatic venting or dumping of the reactor to a safe location.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- After the investigation of the accident, it was found that operators used to open the reactor manway after every batch cycle to clean the reactor. Long standing practice at the facility was to then close the manway and secure it using only 4 of the 18 clamps specified by the manufacturer. The risk posed by this practice had not been recognized because the reactor normally ran at near-atmospheric pressure, for which four clamps were thought to be adequate. Under this situation, it was estimated that the manway began to leak flammable solvent vapors when the reactor pressure reached approximately 23 psig, well below the reactor's maximum allowable working pressure of 75 psig.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The design of the tubular heat exchanger used as a condenser made it difficult to remove for inspection or cleaning. Inspection of this equipment after the accident showed that it was badly fouled, likely reducing the condenser capacity at least 25 per cent. The company had no program to systematically monitor and control water side fouling, and it was found that there was not any inspection&amp;nbsp; or cleaning process to remove the scale, rust and sediment accumulated on the tube during 30 years of service.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"Other":[""]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","CauseType":{"Type_ID":1,"Category":"all","Description":"none"},"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["5629fe9a-f22d-6661-84fd-6a8cc7dbb9e4"],"Consequence_Description":["&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;1 opeartor was killed and 14 were injured&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The blast destroyed the facility and damaged off-site structures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fires following the explosion generated thick smoke, and local residents were asked to shelter in-place for several hours.
