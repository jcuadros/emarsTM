At 20.30 the operator of the 14.00 stopped the recirculation pump; at 22.00 a new operator began working he did the same things of his previous colleague, checking the control room and the plants.&lt;br&gt;The 15th of August 2002 the operator during his controls saw that the upper valve of the tank released some steam and the thermostat arrived at the scale end exceeding 120°C, he closed the heating steam valve and switched on the external cooling system of the tank.
