This situation only occurs during shortage of EO , e.g. during turnaround phases. Normally railcars are not discharged, but loaded, however the most of the EO is used internally. Prior to the unloading, a cooling unit in the storage area was taken out of production for cleaning and was re-commissioned. This operation included isolating this unit by means of ‘blinds’. After applying startup procedures the operator started the discharge operation. Such operations for safety reasons are exclusively carried out during night shifts. Initially a small batch for quality assessment was discharged into a dedicated tank without any problem. Shortly before the incident, the transport line was rechecked by the operator, valve settings were adjusted to facilitate transfer to the main spherical storage tank. Upon commencing transfer, the operator encountered problems generating a sufficient flow from the pump. Several re- checks of ( valve, pressure etc.) settings and lineups, and confirmations were carried out. After restart attempts, and increasing (nitrogen) vapour pressure in the railcar, an apparently normal pressure gradient and fluid flow was monitored. Sometime later, EO gas alarm was triggered, that shortly thereafter ceased an next was interpreted as a ‘false peak alarm’. Shortly after shift switch, the EO transfer operation was halted as a normal safety precaution. The day shift crew in the daylight discovered signs of EO leakage underneath a manifold, and discovered a blind flange that had not been discovered during the night. This obviously alerted senior management, and soon it was concluded that the entire transferred volume ( 32,5 tons) had found its way into cooling water discharge point via a Pressure Relief Valve.

Cleaning the EO Cooler was executed not following a work permit nor was it planned and controlled in the strict turnaround regime.&lt;br&gt;Isolating the cooler in the EO transport system by own personnel for cleaning, remained outside the turnaround (plant maintenance stop) work scope and did not trigger inclusion of these activities into the strict turnaround control routine, nor was it included in a work permit routine.
