An examination of the defective pipe section revealed the presence of a longitudinal crack approximately 16 cm long by 1 cm wide adjacent to the observed local corrosion underneath the thermal insulation lining. Water flowing from a perforated pipe, positioned vertically above the fuel oil pipeline, infiltrated under the leaky thermal insulation layer, first causing the steel to corrode and then perforating the pipe.&lt;br&gt;A pipe verification and maintenance programme was adopted for the refinery site in accordance with a procedure developed in April 2007and designed to establish the various inspection and maintenance periodicities depending on the type of pipe configuration and potential vulnerabilities.&lt;br&gt;The importance of specific maintenance works on the pipe where the leak occurred was however poorly evaluated in this programme, despite a number of warning signs during the preceding months on this particular group of pipes and despite the potentially serious consequences of an accident affecting one of these pipes given the proximity to the riverbank.&lt;div style=\"border-style: none none solid;

Hydrocarbon&lt;br&gt;pellets were recovered on beaches in the neighbouring Vendée Department and as far south as the Isle of Rhé. Pollution cleanup efforts,&lt;br&gt;in some cases requiring mobilisation of up to 750 people at the same time, lasted three and a half months to clean not only some 60 km of fouled riverbanks, but also wetlands further inland (swamps, reed beds, etc.).&lt;br&gt;Public access restrictions were issued for certain beaches and fishing was prohibited in the estuary; the restrictions would gradually be lifted between 04/04 and 18/04/2008.&lt;br&gt;The environmental impact assessment on the flora and fauna was promptly initiated by setting up an accurate inventory of the number of affected birds. Observations performed twice a week by the National Office for Hunting and Wildlife revealed that that the number of bird deaths caused by this pollution spill was less than 10 throughout the entire Loire- Atlantique Department. The proportion of oiled birds kept decreasing as pollution cleanup progressed, with the affected bird population gradually leaving the area as time went by.&lt;br&gt;Nonetheless, several tens of dead animals were recorded in both the Vendée and Charente- Maritime Departments over the following days, even though no scientific causality correlation could be established, especially given the type of species involved.&lt;br&gt;The operator provided most of the manpower and took financial liability for all damages, pollution cleanup costs and compensations to affected professionals.&lt;br&gt;"],"Human":[0],"Environmental":[1],"Cost":[0],"Disruption":[0]},"HumanOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"HumanOffSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"DetailHumanOffSite":{},"DetailHumanOnSite":{},"DetailHumanEmergency":{},"EnvironmentalOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"inland: metropolitan development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"inland: urban development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"inland: rural development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"inland: parkland/commonland","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"inland: grassland/pasture/meadow","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"inland: arable land/crops/vineyards/orchards","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"inland: woodland;
