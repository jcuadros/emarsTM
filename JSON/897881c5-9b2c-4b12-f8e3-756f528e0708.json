Since the operators of small installations have difficulty in classifying all their products by means of standardized tests, at the very least, a stricter implementation of existing regulations has to be sought;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Compliance with the onsite safety procedures in force in the different areas. Vigilance on this point tends to wane with time and at busy periods;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maintenance of rigorous control of the operation conditions and the amounts of hazardous products presents in the manufacturing and storage units.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These basic rules already figure in the French regulations applicable to this activity sector.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the technical level, even if the exact origin of the disaster remains unknown, several aggravating factors have been identified:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bulk storage in crates of the candle bombs, creating thus confinement conditions for these products, undoubtedly contributed in crating detonation conditions;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fact that the stored bombs were primed could have led to their mass ignition by friction. This is because the priming process consists in coating the outer surface of the bombs with a layer of gunpowder for the purpose of ensuring the propagation of the flame from one bomb to the next inside the candles;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The proximity of the storage area of these products to the two manufacturing shops tends to introduce a risk of domino effect which may be wrongly evaluated. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A surprise inspection operation was launched on 12 establishments in the Aquitaine region 3 weeks after the accident.

The only two people working on filling the bombs in this building were the victims, their bodies being found some fifteen metres away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As of today, different investigations are in progress regarding this accident:&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; a judicial investigation (a criminal investigation assisted by a laboratory of the scientific police);&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; an administrative investigation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The effect of the explosion of building 9 was surprising. There was a detonation, although the behaviour expected of the products present in the storage facility where the detonation occurred was:&lt;br&gt;- rapid, highly intense flame without any significant blast, in accordance with the classification 1.3 of these products as defined in the pyrotechnic regulations in force.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The zones of effects determined by the operator in the safety assessment initially performed were not more than 20 m for the lethal effect zone and 38 m for the irreversible effect zone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Considering the consequences of the accident, an expert advice bureau concluded that the detonation was equivalent to 15 to 30 kg of TNT. The shockwave recalculated on the basis of these assumption indicates a maximum extent of the radios for the lethal effect zone and the&amp;nbsp; irreversible effect&amp;nbsp; zone respectively in the order of 40 m and 70 m.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In view of observations made on the ground it is possible that one of the 2 persons, or possibly both, were inside the candle loading room at the time (9B2).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is also possible that this operation was&amp;nbsp; being conducted at the same time as the manufacture of the bombs (forbidden procedure).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hypotheses concerning the circumstances:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The formation of a crater inside the storage area indicates that a considerable quantity of products detonated. Investigations finally took 3 potential causes into consideration:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- the risk presented by the products usually stored in this area may have been wrongly assessed (the risk of detonation had not been taken into account). It is customary in this branch of activity to classify stars and small-diameter bombs as non-detonating products. As these products are not sold as they stand, the operator did not charge an approved certification body to perform the necessary testing procedures for classification. Storing the products in bulk and in a confined space may support the hypothesis of detonating product behaviour. Nevertheless the ignition remains unknown.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;- The products stored were exposed to a violent shock and the energy absorbed released the detonation. On this hypothesis, the shock may have been generated by a first accident on one of the two adjacent workstations (9B1 and 9B2),&amp;nbsp; transmitted to the storage area (9A). However, detailed examination of the concrete floor of these two rooms (9B1 and 9B2) revealed no traces of explosion (no impact, no fragmentation of the concrete or traces of burning). As regards the possible transmission of the explosion from one area to the other, it should be noted with respect to the projectiles recovered and the accounts of witnesses, that at the time of the accident, the door of the storage area may have been left open (though this is prohibited by the safety regulations) and there may have been a handling trolley in vicinity of this door. This trolley might have been pushed towards the storage area by the projectiles generated by a first explosion. Pieces of this trolley were found 150 m from the building in the direction of access door to room 9A.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- There may have been an unauthorized detonating product inside the room which caused the bombs to detonate when it caught fire. The product input/output register of building 9 was examined. The register did not show that storage capacity had been exceeded or the presence of any products other than the 50 and 60 mm bombs. Analysis of the debris from the bottom of the crater may allow to identify the composition of the pyrotechnic compound that detonated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hypotheses concerning the triggering event:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The initial ignition source and its location still remain unknown. A first explosion one of the workstations would have left marks on the concrete. An ignition source could have&amp;nbsp; directly generated in the storage area in case of improper handling.
