It should further be noted that the substance processed in the area where the accident happened is not listed in Annex I to the Directive. The analysis of the information collected showed that the accident was possible and identifiable. In fact, explosions of combustible dust are events that have been widely studied and consequently the conditions in which they are liable occur have been officially identified. It is therefore possible to foresee the effects of a potential dust explosion and put specific measures in place to prevent both the formation of clouds of suspended dust particles, and the formation and presence of an active source of ignition. In the light of such considerations, work involving the use of combustible powders should have been included in the ‘Risk assessment report: major accident risks and the consequences of major accidents’. The only major accident risk envisaged in that report appears to be that a hypothetical explosion in building B or G would be fatal (0.14 bar) at a distance of up to 173 m, cause irreversible injuries (0.07 bar) at up to 281 m and cause reversible injuries (0.03 bar) at up to 533 m. &lt;br&gt; The plant’s Safety Management System was reviewed in 2008, 2009 and 2011.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The 2011 review noted that the plant operator, in response to the irregularities detected previously in 2008 and 2009, drew up and established its own Safety Management System that was sufficient to meet the legal requirements. A subsequent on-the-spot check in 2013 showed that the latest instructions had been acted upon and that the operator had taken care to update the Internal Emergency Plan prompted by changes to the company’s organisation chart. The decision to merge the Safety Management System (SMS) (based on the previous technical legislation) with an Occupational health &amp;amp; safety management system (OHSMS) (based on international standard OHSAS 18001) clearly demonstrates the operator’s intention to implement an overall improvement of the Plan.&lt;/p&gt;"],"EmergencyResponce_Descr":["&lt;p&gt;Following the call to the emergency services registered at 10.51 a.m., the fire brigade, ambulance service and police came to the scene immediately, given their distance from the plant. The authorities intervening at the scene notified the prefecture and judiciary by telephone. Following the security check of the area affected by the event, the Agency department responsible for safety at work intervened. The internal emergency procedure had not been triggered as, when the event occurred, the only employees in the factory were the two individuals involved in the event.&lt;br&gt;The effects of the accident were essentially confined to the areas inside the factory (the part of the mixer drum thrown outside the factory perimeter by the blast did not cause any injuries or accidents). The administrations involved, working together with the Prefecture, set up two of the five road blocks provided for in the external emergency plan (EEP) to ensure access for emergency vehicles. An air ambulance was used to transport the injured workers to hospital, as they required treatment at a major burns unit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The technical assistance consisted mainly of extinguishing the outbreaks of fire on the wooden structure of the destroyed roof and the remains of the clothing the workers had left on the spot immediately after the explosion. Fire extinguishing and safety checking operations were completed at around 14.05.

As a result of this, the roofing in the area was damaged.&amp;nbsp;Analysis of the available evidence indicated that the event may have originated from the ignition of a cloud of combustible dust (vegetal carbon dust).There is still uncertainty regarding what caused the dust to ignite. Ruling out inappropriate behaviour by the operators and taking into consideration the favourable weather conditions: a dry, cold winter's day, one possible scenario is that the accumulated static electricity in the clothing of one of the operators may have generated a spark when he was checking on the fineness of the coal dust, thereby triggering the explosion. There was no formal procedure in place stipulating the use of special specific antistatic clothing for that type of processing or requiring that particular attention be paid to equalising the electrical potential between the equipment and the operator before work was carried out on the machine (loading, checking, emptying operations). Looking further into the security management aspects, it was found that the operation was not considered hazardous.
