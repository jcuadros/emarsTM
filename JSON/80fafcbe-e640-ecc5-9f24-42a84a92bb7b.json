For reasons not yet clear, a considerable release of gas into the atmosphere occurred. A vapour cloud was  consequently generated, which invaded the plant. Being not able to stop the release, the man gave the alarm following the procedures, to the firemen, the national railway (whose tracks run close to the establishment) etc. After the arrival of the firemen, just when initiating their action, a first explosion took place, followed by a fire. The fire involved the two firemen teams, the truck-vessel driver and the employee who had given the alarm. The truck vessel was cracked in the above side (a hole of about 500 mm) with release of a big amount of propane and formation of a little fireball. The fire's heat-radiation caused the explosion of a nearby truck-vessel containing only few litres of LPG. A fragment of this vessel (1500 mm long) was found at a distance of 500 m, after it had provoked the crash down of the roof of a room close to a one-family house. Other fragments were spread around at minor distances. The fire, besides destroying the two motor-pumps of the fire-fighting team, affected 2 other truck vessels containing 12 and 35 m3 of propane and an empty truck vessel (12 m3) and 2 railway-vessels of propane (70 m3 capacity) waiting for unloading.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The accident originated at 7.30 on 15 march 1996, when an employee of the company was transferring liquid propane from a truck-vessel (35 m3), standing there from the evening before, to the fixed storage installation. For causes not yet identified by the authority of Treviso, a big leak of propane occurred with the consequent formation of a flammable cloud about 1,5 m high. At 7.40, being impossible to stop the leakage, the employee gave the alarm by a multiple automatic device, foreseen by the emergency plan and calling directly the firemen of Treviso. About 10 minutes later, two motor vehicles of the firemen arrived into the establishment taking position between the office building and the bottling platform, where it was assumed that the propane cloud had arrived that moment. In such position the two motor-vehicles were at 35m from the truck-vessel which had caused the release. While starting the action to disperse the cloud, for not yet established causes, a first explosion occurred and a fire spread up to the truck-vessel, which was source of the release. The fire which involved all the vessels and truck-vessels standing nearby and only partially one of the 12 storage tanks forming the fixed installation, was put under control by the intervention of other fire brigades. at about 16.00 o'clock the same day. The population evacuation in a radius of 400 m from the establishment has been protracted, precautionally, up to the morning of the following day. As far as it concerns the crack formation (500 mm large) on the top of the tanker which had released, it should have occurred 10-15 minutes after the fire broke out, while the explosion of the half-empty tanker (12 m3) occurred at about 9 hrs). This last caused the complete destruction of the metallic vessel, which divided into fragments of various size; the fragment retrieved at greater distance from the origin is the same which demolished the roof of a room annexed to a private uni-familiar residence 500 m far from the establishment and sited in the residential area of the town causing only material damages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;
