The automatic systems for foaming were activated and the on-site emergency services were quickly on the scene. They were joined by the external emergency services. The fire was extinguished at 15.23. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Two firemen were taken to hospital having come into contact with cumene, a mild irritant. They were released following check-up and have suffered no long-term effects. &lt;br&gt;There was no environmental issue outside of the plant area and there was no risk to the local community. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was found that there was an unexpected accumulation of methyl hydroperoxide (MHP) in the upper part of column K23 during normal operation. During the shut down of the column, the MHP was enriched in the aqueous side draw. Because of specific circumstances parts of this water could flow into the hot heat exchanger, where a thermal explosion of the MHP containing liquid led to an over pressurization of the apparatus. The explosion tore off the feed and outlet pipes. Cumene mainly leaked from the long pipe towards a buffer tank and ignited. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Cumene is a colorless, flammable liquid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;INCIDENT DESCRIPTION&lt;br&gt;On Sunday April 9th K23 was being shutdown in order to perform a regulatory inspection of the column reboiler.&amp;nbsp; The shutdown of K23 was being conducted as outlined in the procedure. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first focus in shutting down K23 was stopping the feed and evacuating the bottom of the column. At 13.17, the feed to K23 from the Cumene Extraction Unit was stopped by closing a manual valve at the Cumene Extraction Unit.&amp;nbsp; At approximately the same time, the level controller for the sump of K23 was placed in manual operation with a fixed valve position to allow K23 to be pumped empty to Tank 93. The level of K23's sump immediately began to decrease, reaching 10% by 13.19.&amp;nbsp; The level remained stable at 10%, although material was continually pumped from K23.&amp;nbsp; This is an indication that the level transmitter was not reporting correctly and that the actual level was below the lower nozzle of the level instrument.&amp;nbsp; Based on calculations, it is estimated that approximately 1 m3 of material remained in K23 below the lower nozzle of its level instrument.&amp;nbsp; At 13.25, K23's bottom pump began to cavitate, indicating that the column was nearly empty, and was shut down at 13.28.&amp;nbsp; The bottoms product from K23 is cooled by the feed in a preheater (WBG2336).&amp;nbsp; Having already shut off the feed to K23, there was no cooling of the bottoms product as indicated by a temperature rise on the outlet of WBG2336 going to Tank 93. This temperature indicator reached a maximum temperature of 128 °C at 13.24, which is the same time that K23 was empty.&lt;br&gt;The second focus in shutting down K23 was preventing low boiling components from entering the bottom of the column. To ensure that the low boiling components remained in the overheads of the column, the steam flow controller was placed in manual operation at 13.19 and steam input was reduced over a three-minute period.&amp;nbsp; At 13.25 the steam condensate temperature increased indicating that heat transfer was no longer taking place due to K23's sump being empty.&amp;nbsp; At 13.29, the steam flow was stopped by placing the controller at 0% output.&amp;nbsp; The interface level in BBG2305 began increasing at 13.25, indicating the accumulation of additional water in this vessel.&amp;nbsp; This level increase was a combined result of shutting off the steam flow to K23 and continuing to reflux material from BBG2303 to the top of K23.&amp;nbsp; At 13.39, the reflux flow controller was placed in manual operation at 0% output.&amp;nbsp; At 13.54, BBG2305's level controller was placed in manual control at a fixed valve position of 10%.&amp;nbsp; The outlet flow from BBG2305 was estimated to be 25 liter/min and resulted in a continuous decrease of the aqueous level in BBG2305.&amp;nbsp; At 13.58, the aqueous level in BBG2305 went to 0%, indicating that organic material was then being pumped from BBG2305 to Tank 93.&lt;br&gt;At approximately 14.00 an explosion occurred at WBG2336, which resulted in a fire in the South West corner of Distillation Unit 1. The sprinkler and foam systems for Distillation Unit 1 were immediately activated. The site emergency response team quickly responded to the incident and was later joined by outside emergency services. The fire could not be extinguished until 15.23 due to being unable to successfully isolate fuel sources from the fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid

Such a pressure could be reached by for example a gas explosion. &lt;br&gt;Four scenarios were identified during the incident investigation as possible causes of the over pressurization. The scenarios are as follows:&lt;br&gt;\"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Thermal Expansion occurring during a blocked in condition&lt;br&gt;\"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;CHP spontaneously decomposing within the exchanger&lt;br&gt;\"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;MHP slowly decomposing to form hydrogen and oxygen thereby creating an atmosphere which at only low activation energy could lead to an explosion &lt;br&gt;\"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;MHP spontaneously decomposing within the exchanger.&lt;br&gt;Thermal Expansion&lt;br&gt;During the shut down of the column there were several manual valves closed in order to isolate K23 from other processes. Therefore, the possibility for a blocked in condition of WBG2336 needed to be evaluated. The feed to WBG2336 was stopped by closing a manual valve (V1) in the Cumene Extraction Unit. After K23 had been emptied and the bottom pump was stopped, the manual valve (V2) at the discharge of the pump was closed. This isolated WBG2336 from the bottom of K23, but allowed for an opening at the outlet from WBG2336 to Tank 93.&amp;nbsp; At this same time, the manual valve (V3) at the outlet of WBG2336 to K23 was also shut. Shortly after that, approximately 9 minutes, the operator realized that he had closed the wrong valve. At this point the operator opened the manual valve (V3) at the outlet of WBG2336 to K23 and closed the manual valve (V4) at the cold side inlet to WBG2336.&amp;nbsp; A spike in the flow meter (FR82331) on the feed line to K23 provides an indication of this valve manipulation. Based on the short period of time of the blocked in condition and short duration of the associated flow spike, the pressure buildup was determined to be insufficient to cause damage to WBG2336. It was also determined that the severity of the damage to WBG2336 could not have been caused by thermal expansion.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, this scenario was eliminated as a possible cause for the over pressurization of WBG2336.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spontaneous Decomposition of CHP&lt;br&gt;During normal operation of K23, there is approximately 2% CHP in the feed to and bottom product from the column. Due to the highly reactive nature of CHP, the possibility of spontaneous decomposition needed to be evaluated. An analysis of the material from the bottom of K23 at 10.00 on April 9th showed that the CHP content was 1.43%, which was in line with expected values. An analysis of a sample from the feed line to WBG2336 following the incident indicated that the CHP content was 0.92%, which was slightly below the expected value.&amp;nbsp; Based on testing it is known that even at a temperature of 140 °C, no instantaneous decomposition of 2% CHP would occur. In a weak acid system, pH &amp;gt; 2, CHP would decompose mainly to DMPC and ACP through thermal decomposition. It would also decompose partially to phenol and acetone through acid catalyzed decomposition. Based on this information the spontaneous decomposition of CHP was eliminated as a possible scenario for the over pressurization of WBG2336.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MHP Decomposition to Hydrogen and Oxygen&lt;br&gt;During normal operation, there was approximately 0.2% MHP in the feed, 0.1% in the bottom product, and below 3% in the aqueous phase of K23's side draw.&amp;nbsp; A partial decomposition of MHP to methanol and hydrogen was expected in K23 based on operating experience.&amp;nbsp; However, samples taken from the side draw receiver (BBG2305) and the overhead receiver (BBG2303) following the incident showed increased levels of MHP in both vessels.&amp;nbsp; After the incident the MHP concentrations in BBG2305 and BBG2303 were determined to be 28 and 8 % respectively. The pH figures of both liquids were below 3. &lt;br&gt;Although it was known that the feed to column K23 contained only small amounts of MHP, it was not known that MHP could be concentrated in localized areas. A literature review on this topic identified only one case where increased MHP concentrations were linked to an explosion in a process for making surfactants. Due to the lack of physical properties for MHP, this condition is difficult to model. However, after making certain assumptions, a simulation for the operation of K23 could be performed. The simulation indicated that MHP could be concentrated in the upper section of the column in the aqueous phase and remain there during normal operation with a peak of around 7%.&amp;nbsp; Obviously, as shown by the analysis of material in BBG2305 after the incident, the MHP was concentrated up to a much higher concentration. This was probably caused during specific shut down conditions at relatively high reflux ratios. The identified location of the MHP peak was between the top tray, where reflux is added to the column, and just above the side draw. Thus, the temperature profile and outlet configuration could allow for K23 to reach equilibrium with an area of localized high concentration of MHP in the top section and low concentrations in all of the outlet streams. K23 is designed so that all liquid contained above the side draw is directed to BBG2305. Therefore, when K23 is shut down and its contents are allowed to flow into the bottom, the concentrated MHP would flow into BBG2305 where it would be separated with the aqueous phase and be pumped to Tank 93. This condition is supported by the sample analysis from material in BBG2305 following the incident, which indicated MHP concentrations that were much higher than expected during normal operation. In addition to MHP the simulation showed a much lower peak for hydrogen peroxide H2O2, which was in the feed to the column, too. With a concentration of 20 wppm in the feed the estimated peak was 100 wppm besides the 7 % MHP. The H2O2 concentration in BBG2305 after the incident was determined to be 385 wppm besides 28 % MHP. As well as for MHP the calculated maximal concentration for H2O2 is lower than the analyzed figure, due to a probably higher accumulation during the shut down procedure. &lt;br&gt;Normally, the cumene at the outlet of WBG2336 going to Tank 93 is at a temperature of 35 °C.&amp;nbsp; However, after the feed to K23 was stopped, the temperature of WBG2336 increased to at least 128 °C. This is indicated on the temperature indicator at the outlet of WBG2336 to Tank 93. A review of the piping configuration indicated that in addition to being exposed to the hot cumene exiting WBG2336, the aqueous phase, due to a difference in density, could also migrate into the hot side of the heat exchanger. The bottom section of WBG2336's hot side could be filled with aqueous material by displacement of the hot cumene. This displacement is indicated by a temperature increase from 109 °C to 134 °C on temperature indicator TR82374. Similarly, the top section of WBG2336's hot side could accumulate a vapor phase that could be generated through the decomposition of MHP. Since the hot side of WBG2336 was not equipped with a vent line, this vapor phase would accumulate down to the side outlet of the heat exchanger from where it would then begin to flow into the transfer line to Tank 93.&amp;nbsp; Based on mechanical drawings, it is estimated that the maximum volume of vapor that would accumulate in WBG2336 would be 175 liters.&amp;nbsp; Following a discussion with specialists in the field of explosion testing, it is now known that vapor phases containing hydrogen concentrations in the range of 16% to 90%, with the remainder being composed of oxygen, could be ignited with minimal energy input and a detonation would occur.&amp;nbsp; Under these conditions, even small explosive gas volumes could result in excessive localized pressure upon ignition. &lt;br&gt;Due to the elevated level of MHP in the system, the formation of an explosive atmosphere with hydrogen and oxygen, resulting from the decomposition of MHP, needed to be evaluated, as the review of the system indicated no path for oxygen to enter the system from the atmosphere. The Limiting Oxygen Concentration (LOC) for hydrogen is 4.3 Vol% at normal conditions. Taking into account the higher temperature in the heat exchanger, the LOC was around 3.8 Vol%. A hydrogen containing gas atmosphere with more than 4 Vol % of hydrogen is only explosive if at the same time the oxygen concentration is above the LOC.&lt;br&gt;Based on a few former investigations, it was known that MHP decomposes to hydrogen. The reaction is relatively fast at a high pH and low at a pH below 7. The reaction is enhanced by adding formaldehyde to the MHP containing solution, but again only hydrogen is formed. Oxygen could only be formed in the presence of hydrogen peroxide H2O2, which is present in the aqueous stream (2) from BBD0020. The concentration of&amp;nbsp; H2O2 in the cumene stream (1), which was the feed to K23, was analyzed to be below 20 wppm. The H2O2 concentrations in BBG2305 and BBG2303 were determined to be 385 and 50 wppm respectively, besides the much higher MHP concentrations of 28 % and 8 % respectively. Based on this a simultaneous formation of significant amounts of oxygen from H2O2 besides hydrogen formation from MHP was very unlikely. &lt;br&gt;To verify the mechanism of hydrogen formation from MHP and to exclude a simultaneous formation of critical amounts of oxygen at low pH, several decomposition tests were made. The tests were made with the MHP and H2O2 containing stream (2), as well as with the liquid from BBG2305, taken after the incident. The tests were made in a special adiabatic calorimeter (Vent Sizing Package calorimeter VSP). Around 65 ml were filled in a 110 ml vessel, which was then closed and set under a slight vacuum. The vessel was heated until the thermal decomposition occurred and the content heated up itself under adiabatic conditions. The vessel was cooled down to around ambient temperature and a gas sample was taken. The analyzed gas concentrations were corrected to take into account preliminary air content from slight vacuum. At each test a double gas analysis was made. No peroxides could be analyzed from the remaining liquid, thus there was always a total decomposition. In addition to the gas analysis, such calorimetric tests deliver information about reaction heat and reaction dynamics, see chapter 4.4. In case of a very violent reaction (runaway) the VSP vessel bursts and the content is released to a secondary compartment, which is filled with nitrogen. Ten tests (run 1 to 10) were made.&lt;br&gt;Runs 1 to 6 were made with the MHP and H2O2 containing stream (2) from the process, at different pH. In general, mainly hydrogen is formed in an amount of 25 to 35&amp;nbsp; mol% of the initial amount of MHP. That fits very well to the operational experience of Thermi I. The amount of oxygen varies with the pH. At a low pH, only 20 mol% in maximum of the H2O2 are converted to oxygen. That is not surprising, because in the presence of MHP, formaldehyde is formed which reacts with H2O2 to form hydrogen, too. In contrast, the formation of oxygen from H2O2 is around 100 % at a pH of 7. At a higher pH the formation of oxygen from H2O2 is again reduced. From these test runs a reaction heat of around 340 kJ per mol MHP could be determined. The activation energy of the decomposition reaction is around 120 kJ/mol. These figures indicate that the decomposition reaction is highly exothermic and increases rapidly with increasing temperature. The gas formation is around 12.4 ln (standard norm liter) per mol MHP. &lt;br&gt;Runs 7 to 10 were made with the MHP containing stream from BBG2305. As already mentioned above, only small amounts of H2O2 (385 wppm) were in this stream. Run 7 was made with a diluted sample to be able to get gas samples. Unfortunately the gas analysis failed, but from the exothermic reaction a similar reaction heat was found, as in the tests before. Run 8 was made with a higher concentrated MHP solution of 15.8 %. The reaction behaviour of a solution with such a higher MHP concentration is also described in a Japanese paper. As expected, the calorimeter burst and the content was released into the secondary compartment. A gas sample could not be taken. The results from this test about reaction dynamics of such a higher concentrated MHP solution will be discussed in chapter 4.4. Runs 9 and 10 were made again with a lower concentrated solution to get reliable gas concentrations from the decomposition. Again it could be shown that mainly hydrogen is formed besides small and uncritical amounts of oxygen.&lt;br&gt;For all tests an analyzed concentration of lower than 0.5 Vol% oxygen should be considered as an inaccuracy of taking and analyzing the gas samples. Significant higher concentrations could only be found from decomposition of solutions with significant amounts of H2O2, see runs 1 to 6. As only small amounts of H2O2 were present in the side stream from K23 besides a high concentration of MHP, the decomposition could only lead to low concentrations of oxygen, see runs 9 to 10. The decomposition of such a solution could not lead to an explosive gas atmosphere. The oxygen concentration would have been always below the Limiting Oxygen Concentration of 3.8 Vol%. Based on these results, the formation of an explosive gas atmosphere and a successive ignition was eliminated as a possible scenario for the over pressurisation of WBG2336. Nevertheless it will be recommended to develop guidelines for proper handling of liquids containing MHP and/or H2O2 to prevent any accumulation of flammable atmosphere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spontaneous Decomposition of MHP&lt;br&gt;As stated in the previous section, normal MHP concentrations are relatively low throughout the system and a partial decomposition of MHP to methanol and hydrogen was expected in K23 based on operating experience. Samples taken from the system, following the incident indicated MHP concentrations in BBG2305 and BBG2303 as 28 and 8 % respectively.&amp;nbsp; Due to the elevated level of MHP in the system, the spontaneous decomposition of MHP, leading to a thermal explosion, needed to be evaluated.&amp;nbsp; A thermal explosion of a reactive liquid, what is also called a runaway reaction, leads to a temperature and pressure increase due to the heat and gas formation, all effects increasing exponentially with increasing temperature. As already described in the previous section, the MHP concentration in the column could be concentrated in the upper section of the column in the aqueous phase and remain there during normal operations. Therefore, when K23 was shut down, the concentrated MHP could flow into BBG2305 where it was separated with the aqueous phase and pumped to Tank 93. As described in the previous section, this aqueous material could migrate to WBG2336 and filled the bottom section of the exchanger's hot side after stopping the pump PBG2300. Based on the temperature indication at the outlet of the hot side, it is known that this area was at a temperature of at least 128 °C.&amp;nbsp; At this temperature, it was known that MHP will thermally decompose.&amp;nbsp; However, both the decomposition velocity, nor the amount of energy that would be generated by this elevated concentration of MHP, were not known yet. &lt;br&gt;The test run 8, was made with a solution of 15.8 % MHP and took place under adiabatic conditions. The test showed a continuous increase of temperature up to 180°C and an increase of pressure because of gas formation. At this temperature, the pressure was around 20 bar and the vessel burst. From this test the kinetics of the MHP decomposition could be evaluated, which allows to calculate the temperature and pressure increase over time for adiabatic conditions and various conditions regarding MHP concentration and starting temperature. Based on the reaction heat of 340 kJ/mol, an aqueous solution would heat up with around 17°C per one percent decomposed MHP under adiabatic conditions. &lt;br&gt;The Japanese paper, presents some results from decomposition tests of MHP solutions up to 16.3 %. A reaction heat of 341 kJ/mol MHP was found, what is very similar to the results from the own investigations. For the 16.3 % MHP solution a maximal heat rate of around 20°C per second is reported in the Japanese paper, what was the maximal detection rate in that test apparatus. From the experiment at Degussa with a 15.8% MHP solution a heat rate of 30°C per second was detected, just before the vessel burst at 180°C. Thus, for the same MHP concentration the decomposition rate of the side draw from K23 was similar or even higher than reported in the Japanese paper. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;It is now very likely, that the following scenario happened: At around 13.28, when K23's bottom pump was stopped, the aqueous phase could flow into WBG2336 by displacing hot cumene. The aqueous phase from K23's side draw vessel BBG2305 had a temperature of around 70°C. Hot cumene was displaced and flowed to Tank 93, As already mentioned, this was indicated by the temperature increase from 109 °C to 134 °C by the indicator TR82374. After reaching this maximum at 13.39, the temperature dropped down to finally 106 °C at 14.00. In maximum, the lower part of the hot side of the spiral heat exchanger could be filled up with the aqueous phase, what was around 155 liters. By initial gas formation from MHP decomposition, hydrogen could accumulate in the upper part of the hot side of the spiral heat exchanger. The aqueous phase could heat up in contact with the hot cumene and the hot steel from the heat exchanger, as well as by MHP decomposition, until it started to boil. The pressure in the heat exchanger was around 0.7 barg, coming from the backpressure of Tank 93. The boiling point of pure water at this pressure is 115°C. But as the aqueous phase contained light boilers like MHP, acetone and methanol, the boiling point was lower, probably around 106°C, which was finally indicated by TR82374. First the vapor could accumulate, besides hydrogen, in the upper part of the hot side of the spiral heat exchanger and then had to release to the line towards Tank 93. The initial MHP concentration in the aqueous phase from BBG2305 was probably below 3 %, as it was from normal operation of K23. After the incident the MHP concentration in BBG2305 was 28 %. It is assumed, that the mean concentration in the heat exchanger was finally 15 %, what is approximately the average of these two figures. By evaporating, the heat from MHP decomposition could initially be discharged, until the thermal explosion occurred. Due to heat removal by evaporation at the beginning, the effective MHP concentration, which finally caused a thermal explosion, was lower. Nevertheless, the gas formation from 6 % MHP is already sufficient to exceed a pressure of 15 barg, what caused the failure of the heat exchanger. Form the kinetics a runaway of a 15 % MHP solution occurs within 100 seconds, starting at 106°C. At a temperature of more than 115°C, the pressure increase over time from gas formation is higher than 10 bars per second. Such a high pressure gradient could not be compensated by a release of the gas towards Tank 93, because the inertia of the liquid in the long pipe was too high.&amp;nbsp; Consequently the heat exchanger burst, as it could not withstand a pressure of more than 15 barg. Based on these investigations, a thermal explosion (runaway) of a higher concentrated MHP solution is the cause for the over pressurisation of the spiral heat exchanger WBG2336.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"Other":[""]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment
