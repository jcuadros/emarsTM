- There was no UVCE (Unconfined Vapour Cloud Explosion) because the product was already at a temperature higher than its flash point.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - It was possible to limit damage due to the fact that the heat resisting lines and reactors did not fail, in spite of the low flow rate of the charge within vessels and pipework, the flow of the charge being&amp;nbsp; an essential element for cooling the equipment.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - Because of the position of water curtains, the fire did not spread.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - The positioning of the curtains was sensible as regards the vertical position of the plume: This was because the choice of siting of the cannons prevented any domino effect which there could well have been in view of the configuration of the site (units separated by bays about fifteen metres wide).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Technical issues: improvements to limit the consequences of a similar leak are as follows:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

It was classified level 3 of the scale, as published&amp;nbsp; in February 1994 by the Committee of Competent Authorities for the implementation of the Seveso directive,&amp;nbsp; in accordance with that criterion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The accident:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;A leak occurred at the reboiler seal surface, on the hot fluid side, and immediately ignited causing an almost vertical plume of flame a dozen metres long.&lt;br&gt;The purpose of the reboiler is to provide the energy necessary for the column to operate. The column consists of the pre-treatment stripper, depending on the hydrotreatment unit. It is a preparation phase for the reformer input. The reboiling energy is provided by the output from the reformer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sequence of events:&lt;br&gt;The settings (pressure and associated throughputs) on the two circuits, analysed after the accident, show that the leak occurred on the hot fluid side (thus containing output from the reformer).
