This prefectoral order obliged the company to issue and submit for approval the procedures prior to the emptying operations of the benzoyl chloride tank and of another tank containing aluminium chloride (CAS 7446-70-0); the procedures were subject to validation by a third party expert.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Classified Installations Inspectorate also requested the operator to submit&amp;nbsp; an accident report. &lt;br&gt;The analysis of the accident report and the on-site investigation have shown the following failures:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- failure to notify the accident to the Classified Installations Inspectorate (DRIRE)&lt;br&gt;- absence of a management representative on the site and failure in managing the organisation and decision chain with respect to the safety issues&lt;br&gt;- late release of the onsite contingency plan&lt;br&gt;- organisational failure of the operator in managing the immediate consequences of the accident&lt;br&gt;- corrosion of the external tank wall&lt;br&gt;- overflow alarm of the tank not connected to the control room&lt;br&gt;- bad condition of the joint on the man-hole flange of the tank&lt;br&gt;- carrying out of the emptying procedure presenting hazards to the personnel and the environment consequent to a faulty hazard assessment which led to the use of incompatible substances and a wrong evaluation of the consequences of such an operation.&lt;br&gt;- missing hazard labelling on the methanol container&lt;br&gt;- bad condition of the fire fighting hoses on the site&lt;br&gt;- The validity of a certain number of Dräger detector tubes for HCl had expired in 1998&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"EmergencyResponce_Descr":["When the accident occurred several alarms were triggered in the guard room, the guard alerted the onsite fire fighting station .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The personnel attempted to abate the cloud by setting up a water curtain and by spraying the tank.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The public emergency response services&amp;nbsp; were&amp;nbsp; alerted by neighbours of the installation who had observed an abnormal gas cloud and were suffering from burning eyes. The emergency response services arrived on the site approximately 10 minutes after having been called. The Classified Installations Inspectorate (DRIRE) was notified by the emergency response service of the fire brigade one hour after the accident. The management of the installation was not present on-site when the accident occurred. The management reached the installation at 13:15 h following an explicit request of the Classified Installation Inspectorate (DRIRE). The Onsite Contingency Plan (POI - Plan d'Opération Interne) was only activated by the operator&amp;nbsp; 2 hours later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The emergency response services responded by sending the chemical emergency unit and several vehicles (pump-trucks and ambulances equipped to carry victims injured or asphyxiated ). The spray water collected in the retention ponds was evacuated to&amp;nbsp; a specialised company for disposal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sampling of hydrogen chloride was performed (with Dräger detector tube) by the emergency response services&amp;nbsp; near the storage area and downwind at the outskirts of the premises.

The chemical reaction process had stopped and the system had returned to a stable condition. On request of the Classified Installations Inspectorate (DRIRE) a continuous monitoring of the installations was set up and the mandatory presence of a management representative was&amp;nbsp; imposed&amp;nbsp; for the night and&amp;nbsp; renewed during the following days. A tarpaulin was installed above the tank to protect the tank against atmospheric agents.&lt;br&gt;The Classified Installations Inspectorate (DRIRE) requested the operator to prepare a technical report ( the request was also supported by&amp;nbsp; an urgent prefectoral order) describing the securing works to be performed, the preventive measures to be taken concerning the safety of the operations as well as the necessary emergency&amp;nbsp; response means. Before performing any other operation, the setting up of a new emptying procedure for the tank was requested, the procedure being subject to validation by a third party expert.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two distinct stages were defined: &lt;br&gt;- on one hand preparatory works for securing the storage installation&lt;br&gt;- on the other hand the emptying procedure itself with the cleaning of the tank, these procedures&amp;nbsp; were subject to validation by a third party expert before approval by the Classified Installations Inspectorate (DRIRE).&lt;br&gt;The operations foreseen comprised five phases:&lt;br&gt;- Phase 1 - securing operation&lt;br&gt;- Phase 2 - repair of the leakage point&lt;br&gt;- Phase 3 - fluidisation and homogenisation&lt;br&gt;- Phase 4 - emptying of the tank&lt;br&gt;- Phase 5 - decontamination&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first two phases were carried out on 19th March 2002.

the reasons for this decision were linked with industrial competitiveness and production optimisation This establishment comprised two main activities linked with the handling and storage of toxic and very toxic liquid and solid substances in quantities above the threshold limits for upper tier Seveso establishments. The establishment is governed by a prefectoral order dated 2 April 1997.

The reaction caused the heating of the mixture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A fault tree can be represented schematically as follows:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Solid residues of benzoic acid&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Product stored more than 3 years ----------&amp;gt; emptying impossible ----------&amp;gt; laboratory tests (but the pump was not suitable for pumping solids)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ignorance of the hazards (faulty hazard evaluation))----------&amp;gt; addition of methanol but sampling not representative&amp;nbsp; and distorted results &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;----------&amp;gt;reaction of the products present in the tank and pressure rise ----------&amp;gt; gas cloud over the dome and faulty joint&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;----------&amp;gt;the gas cloud drifted off-site due to the strong blustering wind, part of the cloud was abated ----------&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; Inhabitants were affected&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"Other":["Yes"]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["e6b7b617-acab-736e-3331-72b48b2db874"],"Consequence_Description":["According to the declarations of witnesses, an opaque cloud with fuzzy contours was seen&amp;nbsp; above the installation and drifted towards the houses located some 150 m from the tank involved in the accident.
