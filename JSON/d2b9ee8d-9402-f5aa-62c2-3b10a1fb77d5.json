The explosion, triggering a domino effect involving other drums and bags containing hazardous chemical products present in the hangar, caused the collapse of the hangar due to the pressure wave. The collapse of the structure caused the death of the operator crushed by the debris. The pressure wave injured a second operator who was hospitalised and dismissed in the evening. The pressure wave damaged also the adjoining solids storage hangar, causing the collapse of part of the structure, and ignited some small fires due to spark projection.

It could be assumed that the sodium chlorite decomposed due to the initial violent exothermic reaction with the acid and then by the high temperature reached by the initial explosive reaction. The company declared that 30 t of sodium chlorite were destroyed by the accident, representing the entire quantity stored.&lt;BR&gt;The company admitted the presence of a 1000 l storage tank of peracetic acid at 15% outside of the storage hangar, - the tank was found damaged in proximity of the collapsed hangar,&amp;nbsp; arguing further that the presence of peracetic acid in the explosion point could be justified by the extinguishing water used by the fire brigades.&lt;BR&gt;On the other hand all elements collected by ARPA indicate non correct management procedures of hazardous materials inside the storage facility.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;These statements are however still to be evaluated in the judicial procedure which is still in process.&lt;BR&gt;"],"Other":[""]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["6c0a6ce0-dd2e-8067-6294-454fcd36ca53"],"Consequence_Description":["1 fatality&lt;BR&gt;1 person injured&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Onsite material damage&lt;BR&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
