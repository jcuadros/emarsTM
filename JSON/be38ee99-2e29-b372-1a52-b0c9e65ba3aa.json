This was essentially a Risk Based Inspection review and as a result approximately 3,200 lines were inspected - about 15% of the total refinery system. Another project 'Project 570' was initiated to review the remaining 85% of refinery piping, and 62,000 inspection locations were reviewed, following the guidance in the American Institute Piping Inspection Code API 570, covering the inspection, repair alteration and re-rating of in-service piping systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;b. ConocoPhillips senior management requested a third party audit of all their facilities worldwide, both upstream (exploration and production) and downstream (refining and marketing). This was conducted by specialist consultants with a worldwide reputation in the field of process safety.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;c. The refinery organisational structure was revised to provide clearer definitions of the responsibilities for mechanical integrity. Inspection and mechanical integrity and their associated actions are key risk control activities, and the monitoring of their performance metrics are reviewed routinely by the refinery leadership team. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conclusions and lessons learned:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;a. Management of pipework inspection&lt;br&gt;ConocoPhillips failed to implement an effective system for the inspection of pipework on the Saturate Gas Plant (SGP), to complement that in place for process equipment. The system fell far below recognised industry good practice at the time.&amp;nbsp; In addition they failed to use knowledge and experience from other sections of the plant that should have identified the need for more inspection of the SGP pipework. Over time sufficient pipework condition data should have been obtained, and entered onto an inspection database, to verify the believed integrity and inform assessments of future inspection requirements. Without this both the system and the assessments were inadequate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Key lessons:&lt;br&gt;- Effective pipework inspection systems are a vital major accident prevention measure for high hazard pipework.&lt;br&gt;- Such systems should at least meet current industry good practice standard&lt;br&gt;- Decisions on inspection intervals should be informed by suitable and sufficient information on process conditions and previous inspection findings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;b. Management of change&lt;br&gt;The design and installation of the water injection point in the pipe was not subject to any management of change assessment. Had such an assessment been carried out, the corrosion risk that the injection point introduced for the downstream pipework could have been identified. Similarly no assessment was made of the changes in the use of the water injection point, between continuous and intermittent, over the lifetime of the plant. The frequency of use was a major factor in the rate of the corrosion of the pipework. During periods of continued use more frequent or detailed inspections of the pipework should have taken place to adequately monitor the integrity of the pipe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Key lessons:&lt;br&gt;- Effective management of change systems, which consider both plant and process modifications, are essential to prevent major accidents.&lt;br&gt;- Particular care is needed to ensure that 'quick fix' modifications, during the commissioning and early operation phases of new plant, are covered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;c. Management of corrosion&lt;br&gt;ConocoPhillips corrosion management on the SGP was not sufficiently thorough or systematic to prevent the failure of the pipe. Some positive actions were taken, including the appointment of a full-time corrosion engineer for the refinery, the introduction of divisional corrosion reviews and monitoring of process streams by sampling, and the installation of corrosion probes, following receipt of specific information in 1992 about the vulnerability of carbon steel pipework in the vicinity of water injection points. Unfortunately these activities were allowed to lapse with the result that there was both insufficient data on, and inadequate resource or focus applied to, corrosion as a potential major accident initiator on the SGP.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Key lessons:&lt;br&gt;- Systematic and thorough arrangements are necessary for the effective management of corrosion on major hazard installations.&lt;br&gt;- Such arrangements should ensure that any available information on relevant corrosion degradation mechanisms is identified and acted on.&lt;br&gt;- Adequate resource, including relevant expertise, should be applied to ensure that adequate standards are achieved and maintained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;d. Communication&lt;br&gt;Two significant communication failings contributed to this incident. Firstly the various changes to the frequency of use of of the water injection point were not communicated outside plant operations personnel. As a result there was a belief elsewhere that it was in occasional use only and did not constitute a corrosion risk. Secondly, information from the injection point inspection, which was carried out in 1994, was not adequately recorded or communicated, with the result that the recommended further inspections of the pipe were never carried out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These failings were confirmed in a subsequent detailed inspection of specific human factors issues at the refinery. Safety communications were found to be largely 'top-down' instructions related to personal safety issues, rather than seeking to involve the workforce in the active prevention of major accidents. The inspection identified that there was insufficient attention on the refinery to the management of process safety.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Key lessons:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Effective communication is an important element of any safety management system. In the context of major hazard establishments the accurate recording and effective sharing of information and data relevant to plant corrosion is essential for major accident prevention.&lt;br&gt;- Communication systems should aim to actively involve the workforce in the prevention of major accidents as part of an adequately resourced process safety management system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Measures to mitigate consequences: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Specialist consultants were employed to review the blast damage and explosion over-pressure calculations to improve predictive knowledge. Software used to predict explosion over-pressure was updated and used for all the Humber refinery occupied building risk assessments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recommendations were made to improve the procedures for calling the emergency services, and for deciding when, and by whom, the the off-site alarm should be sounded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lessons from the emergency response on-site and off-site were shared with local industries, emergency planning and the emergency services through the local Major Hazards Group. A process was set up to handle concerns among the community and to carry out repairs in a timely fashion. An additional off-site community alarm was installed to cover South Killingholme residents furthest away from the refinery who could not always hear the existing alarm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Useful references: &lt;/b&gt;The full HSE report into this incident is available at http://www.hse.gov.uk/comah/conocophillips.pdf&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"EmergencyResponce_Descr":["&lt;b&gt;Emergency measures - Remarks: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ConocoPhillips Emergency Response Team led the fire-fightiing effort with the Humberside Fire Service attending; fire crew from an adjacent oil refinery also assisted them as part of the existing mutual aid scheme. \n\nThe incident occurred at 14.21 hours and the refinery general alarm was sounded shortly afterwards. At 14.40 the refinery was shut down because the fire appeared to be out of control. By approximately 15.30 the fire was under control and it was largely extinguished by 17.10 and recorded by the Humberside Fire Service as 'struck out' at 21.01 hours.\n\nThe off-site emergency alarm (Community Alarm) was not sounded at any point during the incident. ConocoPhillips view is that this off-site emergency alarm is only used for foreseen toxic gas releases. The damage caused from the incident was immediate and without warning. The off-site emergency plan was not put into effect. Following the investigation, recommendations were made to improve the procedures for calling the emergency services, and for deciding when, and by whom, the the off-site alarm should be sounded.\n\nIn addition to the Humberside Fire Service, the other emergency services committed significant resources to tackle the incident; Police closed off roads around the refinery, nearby residents were informed to close windows and remain indoors, ambulances were summoned to the site and the local Hospital instigated its major incident procedure. Whilst the property damage in the area was extensive, fortunately there were no serious injuries.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seveso II duties  - remarks: &lt;/b&gt;Although there was an\noff-site emergency plan for this establishment, it was not initiated in\nresponse to this incident. There was also uncertainty as to who was\nresponsible for calling the emergency services.\nFollowing the investigation it was recommended that:\n&lt;br&gt;\na) the procedures should be reviewed to clarify who calls the emergency\nservices, which services should be contacted and the circumstances\nunder which they should be called. All documents and call lists should\nbe revised as appropriate.\n&lt;br&gt;\nb) the circumstances under which the off-site alarm is to be sounded,\nand the person who has the responsibility to sound it, should be\nclarified, and this should be written in to the emergency on-site\nprocedures.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Official action taken - legal action: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Following the investigation into the incident, ConocoPhillips Limited were charged with a number of offences. They pleaded guilty to the charges under Sections 2 and 3 of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974, that:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;a) at the Humber Refinery between 1 January 1996 and 17 April 2001, they did not ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare of their employees; and that &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;b) they also failed to conduct the undertaking in such a way as to ensure, so far as was reasonably practicable, that&amp;nbsp; persons not in their employment who might thereby be affected, were not exposed to risks to their health and safety.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The company were fined £400,000 on each charge with costs of £218,854. They were also fined £20,000 for offences concerning pressure systems legislation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Official action taken - other action: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;HSE served an Improvement Notice on ConocpoPhillips Limited on 1 July 2001 requiring them to draw up an action plan for implementing the provisions of a suitable industry standard for pipework inspections at the refinery and address the corrosion management deficiencies found. This Improvement Notice was complied with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;HSE issued a Safety Alert to other UK oil refineries advising them of the need to have effective inspection systems in place around water injection points in process lines, particularly if they are close to bends in the pipework.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastUser":{"UserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"Name":["MINERVA"],"Surname":["Administrator"],"IsVisibleSensibleData":[false]},"LastDate":["2017-07-11T15:59:38.731"],"ParentCompany":{},"Region":{},"Province":{},"City":{},"PostCode":{},"Concurrency":[0]},"LockedUserId":{},"LockedDate":{},"IsLocked":[false],"IsLockedByMe":[false],"LockedUser":{}},"AccidentProfile_Tab":{"ReportingAuthority":{},"ContactPerson":{},"Reasons":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Substances involved: greater than 5% of quantity in Column 3 of Annex I"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Injury to persons: &gt;= 1 fatalities, &gt;= 6 hospitalizing injuries etc."},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Immediate damage to the environment (according to Annex VI)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Damage to property: on-site &gt;2M &amp;euro;, off-site &gt; 0.5M &amp;euro;"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"Cross-border damage: transboundary accidents"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"Interesting for lessons learned."}],"AffectedCountries":{}},"AccidentDescription_Tab":{"AccidentDescription":{"DominoEffects":[false],"NatechEvents":[false],"TransboundaryEffects":[false],"Contractors":[false],"accTypeRelease":[0],"accTypeFire":[0],"accTypeExplosion":[0],"accTypeTransport":[0],"accTypeOther":{},"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastDate":["2017-07-11T16:00:08.689"],"Concurrency":[0],"Translation":{"VersionId":["694b15da-5d46-0afb-5180-81e89b1279b4"],"LanguageId":["EN"],"AccidentDescription":["Saturate Gas Plant, de-ethaniser column overhead line failure resulting in an inventory loss greater than the 5% Shedule 1 threshold for extremely flammable gases.

The failure occurred downstream of, and in close proximity to, a water injection point that was not part of the original design.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Examination of the failed elbow of the pipework showed that it had failed due to an 'erosion/corrosion' damage mechanism which, over time, had reduced the wall thickness at the outside of the elbow to such an extent that the wall could no longer withstand the internal pressure within the pipe. The wall thickness had been reduced from around 7-8mm to a minimum of 0.3mm. When the pipe failed, it burst open catastrophically,causing a 'full-bore' type of release of the pipe's contents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Metallurgical examination of the pipe revealed that the uncorroded sections of the pipe were internally coated with black iron slphide, known as the 'passivation' layer which, once formed, serves to protect the carbon steel material from further corrosion. However, when the water injection was in operation it washed away the protective coating leaving it open to attack by corrosive agents in the gas stream. Hence the elbow was subject to erosion/corrosion, a process that resulted in the thinning of the pipe wall and eventual failure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The full HSE report into this incident is available at http://www.hse.gov.uk/comah/conocophillips.pdf&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"Other":[""]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["694b15da-5d46-0afb-5180-81e89b1279b4"],"Consequence_Description":["&lt;b&gt;Area concerned - remarks:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The Saturate Gas Plant (SGP) suffered very heavy damage as a result of the force of the blast. Fortunately no one had been in the direct path of the the estimated 175 x 80 metres gas cloud when it exploded. The resultant fire caused further and substantial damage to the SGP. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other buildings on the refinery, up to 400 metres away from the source of the explosion, were badly damaged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The refinery was shut down completely for several weeks following the explosion, followed by a phased start up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An adjacent oil refinery also sustained damage to buildings, although the process plant was unaffected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The explosion caused widespread damage to houses and businesses within a 1km radius of the site. Around 370 individual reports were made of damage to buildings, mainly broken windows and cracks to ceilings and walls. There is evidence of residents suffering shock and distress by the blast, although they were not injured. 71 civil claims for injury damage are being pursued by members of the public.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Debris from the explosion was spread over a wide area. It littered a nearby road to the extent that emergency services had to slow down to negotiate their way through it. Some debris, mainly cladding, was thrown into the air and found betwen 500 metres and 5km away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;People - remarks:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The incident occurred on a public holiday (Easter Monday) when there were only 185 people on site, rather than the normal number of about 800.
