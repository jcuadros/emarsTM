In the same time the internal emergency plan was put in action with the \ninternal fire brigade intervention with foam and water extinguishers of various kinds. \nThe emergency procedure required the evacuation from the nearby plants of all the \npersons not involved in the extinction efforts, which resulted in sustaining only \nmaterial damages and no personnel injuries.

In the first phase a local fire occurred near the atmospheric vessel called TK103, containing a solution of NaOH in water of the RT1 plant (revamping topping) and used for neutralizing the acidity of the raw oil contained in the desalter of the TK2 plant. The fire caused damage to the tank and to the electrical cables running near the vessel. This fire has been definitively extinguished at 9.25. In the second phase at 9.45, an explosion occurred at the exit of the tube from the preheating oven (F301) of gasoil + H2 of the desulphurisation plant. This explosion damaged, besides the oven, various equipment in a radius of about 50 m from the explosion point. The fire following this explosion was of short duration.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First incident: probable underevaluation, by the assigned to the operation, considered as of routine and then not at risk. &lt;br&gt;Second incident: on the base of the available registrations, the cause may have been a series of erroneous consecutive actions by the operator who misinterpreted the instruments indications, and his disposition for the conduction of the process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The consequences of the second incident could have been more serious (not only with damage to structures, but also to people- it needs to be noted that the incident occurred in a zone in which numerous personnel, either internal or external, were present for the modifications going on the near-by plants), if the \"all clear\" internal alarm was given immediately after the end of the first accident; in that case many persons would have returned to their job and would have been taken by surprise by the second accident.

The overflowing hydrocarbons reached the zone in which workers performed \nthe welding. The following fire and the extinguishing operations caused the activation \nof the protection devices of the grounding system, which resulted in interruption of the \nelectrical supply. Such interruption provoked the gasoil supply loss in the oven F301 in \nwhich the second accident occurred.  The increase in the temperature and pressure \ninside the pipes in which gasoil + H2 should have circulated occurred due to this \nsupply loss, with consequent overheating of the pipes resulting in rupture and \nexplosion.  Also in this case, a human error can be reasonably presumed, based on the \navailable computerised registrations, consisting of the undue silencing of alarms due to \ninsufficient supply and of high temperature and pressure and the subsequent omitted \ninterventions as foreseen by the existing procedures.\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"Other":[""]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["abcb5285-aadc-bd0b-a53f-3628023030d7"],"Consequence_Description":["&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;A welder worker received burns in face in the first fire and light trauma to the rear. \nOther 3 workers were presented in the infirmary; some of them showed effects of light \nstate of shock or breathing difficulties.
