The fire involved 25 tanks containing mainly light petroleum products. The sound of the explosion was heard at a great distance from the depot (up to Capri) and witnesses noticed the shock-wave up to Vico Equense. The explosion flame reached a length of hundreds metres. The explosion caused:&lt;br&gt;1- the complete destruction of some buildings and damages to some industrial and civil premises in a radius of various hundred metres from the depot;&lt;br&gt;2- the death of 4 people (two workers of the AGIP company inside the depot and two people living outside the depot, in a building beyond the Sperone channel;&lt;br&gt;3- the injuring of many people hit by debris or fallen during the escape following the accident (the explosion caused a great panic in the population in a large area of the city);&lt;br&gt;4- a large fire in the area of the SIF depot;&lt;br&gt;5- serious damages to the road connecting the city of Naples (street \"Arnaldo Lucci\") to the high-way Napoli-Salerno;&lt;br&gt;6- damages to the rail-way \"Circumvesuviana\".&lt;br&gt;The fire that followed the explosion was characterized by high burning and energy rates of the combustion. There was risk of explosion of fixed roof tanks and propagation of the fire to the nearby areas (where there were others tanks) and to nearby critical industrial premises (Feltrinelli). Also, there was a risk of burned products flowing into the Sperone channel (with consequent damages to the activities in the harbour) and serious risks to the public health. Due to the successive collapse of some storage tanks engulfed in the fire, some fire-balls occurred and the flammable liquid contained was released into the dikes. It was a good choice to send foam (though more expensive) instead of water in the dikes to reduce the effects of the collapse of tanks.

Many people (about 100) were injured (and hospitalized) because they were hit by debris or fallen during the escape following the accident (the explosion caused a great panic in the population in a large area of the city).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MATERIAL LOSS AND COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:&lt;br&gt;The accident caused great damage to the depot and to its structures.
