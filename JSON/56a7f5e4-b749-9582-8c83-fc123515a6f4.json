Detection of the problem&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just as for each process equipment with risks for major accidents, the phenomena which can lead to a degradation of the containment, in this case the storage tank, should be identified and analysed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This accident indicates the possible risks as a consequence of the presence of non mixable phases which can settle out. An investigation of the possible presence of such phases should form a part of the identification of possible corrosive phenomena. If necessary chemical analyses should be performed to determine the corrosive behaviour of these phases (chemical composition, pH,#).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This incident further shows that in the bottom of storage tanks gutters can be formed. In those gutters corrosive products can accumulate, what can result in local, uniform corrosion. In the case water and/or other corrosive products can induce corrosion of the tank bottom, it should be investigated if there is also a problem of gutter forming in the bottom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gutter forming in the bottom of storage tanks is induced by a combination of the size of the storage tank, the local compressibility of the foundation and a relative elastic underground. The gutters are not always visible by the eye. They can be mapped by performing a topographic investigation. The topographic maps are achieved by a surveyor who measures the bottom of the storage tank with a laser.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The local uniform corrosion which is a consequence of the gutter forming is not easily detected. The local reduction of the thickness of the bottom plate can be overlooked if ultrasonic thickness measurements are only performed on a cross banded pattern. If the risk of local corrosion due to gutter forming in the bottom exists, suitable techniques should be used to investigate the bottom plates. These techniques are described below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6.2. Possible solutions&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If local, uniform corrosion induced by gutter forming is a problem, the company should take suitable measures to avoid a loss of containment as a consequence of the corrosion. In the next paragraph some different possible measures are listed according to the place they take in the prevention hierarchy. In function of the specific situation it can be necessary to take multiple measures, if necessary completed with additional measures which are not described here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Avoiding or limiting the presence of corrosive products that can settle out.&lt;br&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Avoid that products settle out (mixing the different phases)&lt;br&gt;Mixing of the products in the storage tank can avoid or limit that insoluble phases settle out. To achieve good results the effectiveness of the mixing is important.&lt;br&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Removing of settled out products&lt;br&gt;It has to be assured by a procedure that settled out products are periodically removed. But note that the draining of settled out products does not guarantee that settlements are removed out of gutters in the bottom.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Avoiding the formation of gutters in the bottom&lt;br&gt;Existing storage tanks can be lifted up and the foundation underneath can be restored. In this case it must be kept in mind that by performing a hydrostatic test it is possible that new settlements can take place. For existing tanks there is also the possibility to analyse the foundation and the underground under the storage tanks in order to gather enough information to perform calculations. These calculations can indicate if the risk of gutter forming exists or not. For new storage tanks a detailed calculations of the foundations can be performed during the design phase to reduce the risk of gutter formation.&lt;br&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lining&lt;br&gt;A lining is applied on the tank bottom and the first shell course. A lining which is well attached will largely reduce the corrosion velocity. A badly adjusted lining will still reduce the uniform corrosion but will promote pitting corrosion underneath the lining. A good attachment of a lining depends on a lot of parameters such as moisture, temperature, kind of lining, not stepping on a not fully hardened layer,#.&amp;nbsp; To achieve guarantee about the thickness of the lining and the attachment of the lining it is necessary to perform measurements on the thickness of the different layers, to perform a conductivity test and to perform a non porosity test. The code API 652 \"Linings of aboveground petroleum storage tank bottoms\" describes the advantages and disadvantages of different kind of linings.&lt;br&gt;6.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Planning of internal inspections based on the corrosion velocity&lt;br&gt;The intervals between internal inspections have to be defined based on the estimated corrosion velocity. This is a general principle that can be found in de API 653 standard \"Tank Inspection, Repair, Alteration and Reconstruction\". Normally the corrosion velocity of the bottom plates is the most important one. In the case of major local corrosion, it will be this higher, local corrosion velocity which is determinative for the inspection interval.&lt;br&gt;The internal corrosion velocity can be determined by analysing the settled out products. Based on graphics which indicate the overall corrosion velocity of the construction material as a function of the corrosive character of these residues (e.g. pH-measurement), the corrosion velocity can be estimated. Based on the corrosion velocity it can be determined how long the storage tank can be safely used before a next internal inspection is necessary. API 653 describes what minimum plate thicknesses have to be measured to use a storage tank safely. If it is expected that large differences can occur in the chemical composition and the properties of the residues, these analyses and the calculation of the inspection interval must be periodically repeated. The analysis of the bottom products can be used to trace other corrosion phenomena (e.g. bacteriological corrosion).&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;7.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Adapted internal inspection techniques&lt;br&gt;Internal inspections in which case ultrasonic thickness measurements are only performed in a cross banded pattern (just to achieve a general impression of the thickness of the bottom of the storage tank) are not sufficient to trace local, uniform corrosion.&lt;br&gt;In order to achieve an entire image of all changes in the thickness of the bottom of a storage tank the bottom must be totally scanned. Floor scans are very useful to measure sudden volume changes in the floor (e.g. pitting corrosion). They can however also be used to trace gradual changes in the thickness of the bottom plates. To guarantee that a floor scan generates accurate information on the state of the entire bottom of the storage tank, certain conditions have to be satisfied.&lt;br&gt;It must be checked if the presence of a lining has an influence on the results of the floor scan.&lt;br&gt;Before the inspection is must be clearly discussed with the performers in which state the storage tank must be presented to achieve good measurements. In some cases the entire bottom of the storage tank must be sand blasted before measurements can be performed. In this case it is necessary to discuss the criteria for the sand blasting in advance. It is also favourable that the contractor who will perform the floor scan inspects the cleaning conditions of the bottom plates.&lt;br&gt;The signal that is generated by the floor scanning apparatus can suffer from drift. This phenomenon is not necessarily a problem if the floor scanning is used to detect pitting corrosion. The moment pitting corrosion is detected, the signal changes so much that even with some drift on the signal, the pitting corrosion is detected. The drift on the electric signal has however a much larger impact when floor scanning is used to detect gradual changes in the bottom floor. To solve this problem it is useful to perform a few ultrasonic thickness measurements on each bottom plate. The signal from the floor scanning apparatus can be gauged for each bottom plate in order to achieve accurate measurements on gradual changes in the bottom thickness.&lt;br&gt;8.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Additional external inspection techniques&lt;br&gt;In addition to the above described internal inspections, intermediate external inspections can be performed in order to gather additional information on the corrosion status of the storage tanks. These inspection techniques, which can be applied when the storage tanks are in duty, are especially useful when there is large uncertainty on the corrosion phenomena and/or on the corrosion velocity.&lt;br&gt;A first technique uses acoustic emission measurements. Microphones are placed on the shell of the storage tank to receive sound waves coming out of the tank. Each sound wave is stored and the source of the noise is calculated by software. The sounds that can be associated with a general corrosion activity have a very high frequency. The data are processed in order to map the places where corrosion activity is found and to determine the density of the corrosion activity. The technique makes it also possible to determine different grades of corrosion activity, going from grade A (very small) to grade E(high corrosion activity). As a function of the established corrosion activity it can be decided to perform immediately an internal inspection on the storage tank (in case of grade E), to reschedule the next internal inspection to an earlier date or to repeat the acoustic emission measurements after a certain period.&lt;br&gt;The acoustic emission technique also allows to detect leaks. These leaks are detected at other frequencies than the frequencies at which the general corrosion activity is detected. This technique makes it possible to detect small perforations in the tank bottom.&lt;br&gt;Another technique to achieve an indication of certain corrosion phenomena is \"long range ultrasonics\". This technique admits to achieve a qualitative image of the status of the annular bottom plates (not from the entire tank bottom) by using guided waves.&lt;br&gt;These external inspection techniques do not gather (quantitative) information about the corrosion velocity and can't be used to enlarge the inspection interval that is based on the corrosion velocity.&lt;br&gt;9.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Applying leak detection techniques&lt;br&gt;Several techniques can be applied to detect a leak in the bottom of a storage tank while the storage tank is in duty.&lt;br&gt;A possible leak detection technique exists of cables placed in the underground at fixed distances. The conductivity of these cables changes if a product is detected in the underground.&lt;br&gt;Larger leaks can be detected by looking for abnormal deviations in the fluid level in the storage tank. If a continuous level measurement is installed on the storage tank, it is possible to install an extra alarm in the control program. The alarm is generated when the fluid level decreases when there are no pumping activities out of the storage tank. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"EmergencyResponce_Descr":["Covering spill with foam\nclean up of spill&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastUser":{"UserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"Name":["MINERVA"],"Surname":["Administrator"],"IsVisibleSensibleData":[false]},"LastDate":["2017-07-11T15:59:38.729"],"ParentCompany":{},"Region":{},"Province":{},"City":{},"PostCode":{},"Concurrency":[0]},"LockedUserId":{},"LockedDate":{},"IsLocked":[false],"IsLockedByMe":[false],"LockedUser":{}},"AccidentProfile_Tab":{"ReportingAuthority":{},"ContactPerson":{},"Reasons":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Substances involved: greater than 5% of quantity in Column 3 of Annex I"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Injury to persons: &gt;= 1 fatalities, &gt;= 6 hospitalizing injuries etc."},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Immediate damage to the environment (according to Annex VI)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Damage to property: on-site &gt;2M &amp;euro;, off-site &gt; 0.5M &amp;euro;"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"Cross-border damage: transboundary accidents"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"Interesting for lessons learned."}],"AffectedCountries":{}},"AccidentDescription_Tab":{"AccidentDescription":{"DominoEffects":[false],"NatechEvents":[false],"TransboundaryEffects":[false],"Contractors":[false],"accTypeRelease":[0],"accTypeFire":[0],"accTypeExplosion":[0],"accTypeTransport":[0],"accTypeOther":{},"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastDate":["2017-07-11T16:00:08.688"],"Concurrency":[0],"Translation":{"VersionId":["6d6a44a6-fc6f-c045-66f2-6992cdcc99a7"],"LanguageId":["EN"],"AccidentDescription":["1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Situation&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The storage terminal contains 7 storage tanks in one large bund. The bund is made of earth. The terminal is situated at some distance from the refinery it is connected with.&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 4 large crude oil tanks of which 3 are situated in a row and a fourth crude oil tank is situated before the second tank. These storage tanks are identified as D1, D2, D3 and D4;&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2 smaller slop oil tanks, D10 and D11;&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; a very small crude oil tank D26.&lt;br&gt;The crude oil tanks D1, D2, D3 and D4 have a capacity of 40 000 m3 and the slop oil tanks D10 and D11 have a capacity of 24 000 m3.&lt;br&gt;The crude oil is delivered by pipeline and is pumped by pipeline to the Refinery.&lt;br&gt;On September 12th, 2005 a minor incident occurred at the storage tank D3. During this incident an amount of 35 m3 crude oil leaked from the bottom of the tank. The exact cause of this incident is not yet known. At the moment the major accident occurred with tank D2 cleaning operations for storage tank D3 were just started in order to inspect storage tank D3 and to determine the causes of the incident of September 12th.&lt;br&gt;At the moment the major accident happened the slop oil tank D10 was full, the slop oil tank D11 was empty, the crude oil tank D4 was partially full, the crude oil tank D2 was for 75% full en the tanks D1, D3 en D26 were empty and in revision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Chronological description of the accident and the intervention&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On October 25, 2005 around 18.15h a major leak at tank D2 was detected. Storage tank D2 contained at that moment almost 33 000 m3 crude oil. Information from the DCS-system situated in the off-sites control room of the refinery indicates that the full inventory of storage tank D2 was released within 10 minutes. Because the contents of the storage tank was released in such a short time, an enormous wave appeared. Due to the amount of crude that was released, the bund was filled ( 40 000 m2 large) with crude up to&amp;nbsp; a height of 1 m. Due to the effect of the crude wave, a small amount of 3 m3 of crude was ejected out of the bund into a nearby creek.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the release the storage tank was leaning forward. It also seamed that the storage tank was sledded of his foundation, although it is not clear if this was a cause or rather a consequence of the incident. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Initially the fire brigade started to cover the bund with fire fighting foam to avoid ignition of the crude oil and to reduce the smell. Directly a large amount of fire fighting foam was donated by the Refinery, other (petro)chemical companies and the fire brigade to cover the very large bund area with foam.&amp;nbsp; Due to the very strong wind that evening and the use of different types of fire fighting foam they did not succeeded to cover the whole bund with foam. Especially the inner part of the large bund (where al the piping and valves are situated) stayed even after several hours uncovered. On the other hand the strong wind had the advantage that no explosive atmosphere was formed above the spill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The contents of the slop oil tank D10 and the crude oil tank D4 was immediatly pumped to storage tanks situated at the refinery itself. The contents of the bund is firstly pumped to the slop oil tank D11. In order to fill the slop oil tank D10 and de crude oil tank D4 with the product in the bund, some manual valves had to be handled. Because of the presence of piping, valves and walking platforms in the bund, is was not possible to reach the valves by boat. Therefore two operators (fully protected with chemical overalls and breathing apparatus) have walked through the crude and manipulated the valves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the next two days the mixture of crude oil, fire fighting foam and water was pumped to the storage tanks D10 and D4. This was done at a velocity of 900 m3 an hour. Afterwards a part of this mixture was send to storage tanks at the refinery. In the afternoon of October 27th , 2005 the bund was mostly empty, except of some smaller pools of crude oil. These pools were removed by vacuum cleaning trucks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On October 28th, 2005 the intervention was finished and the cleaning up of the terminal could start. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Comments&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The storage tank D2 was built in 1970. At that moment the storage terminal belonged to XX. It was sold in 1990 to the Refinery. At that moment all the tanks were inspected and repaired if necessary. This was also the case for storage tank D2. The inspection before the tank D2 was used again was done in 1991. From 1994 until now each 3 years an external inspection was performed. These inspections showed almost no remarks. Next year a total revision of the storage tank was planned. Every three years setting measurements of the storage tanks were carried out. The last measurements were done in 2004. These measurements showed no anomalies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At this moment the cause of this major accident is not yet know. There are some indications that a subsidence (movement of the soil) could have caused this accident, because one month before this accident the crude oil tank D3 also had a leak. More investigation on both tanks is necessary to know if both accidents are related with each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two days after the accident, the bund was nearly empty. At that moment it was clearly visible that a part of the foundation of storage tank D2 had disappeared. Parts of the foundation were found in the bund over a distance of 20 to 30 m. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An important concern after the accident is the stability of all storage tanks at the storage terminal at the left bank. For the moment each day setting measurements are performed. To reduce the risk of another release, most part of the contents of the storage tanks D4, D10 and D11 are pumped to the refinery where it was shipped to Rotterdam. Afterwards these tanks were partially filled with water in order to let the roof float.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the moment the terminal only contains sludge. This sludge is present in the storage tanks D4, D10, D11 and D2.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the accident the company organized already 8 inspections with the authorities in order to discuss al measures they are taking concerning safety and environment. Also a public hearing for the neighbourhood was organized.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Clean-up operations&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Refinery has set up a project group in order to make the terminal safe and start the cleaning of the terminal.&lt;br&gt;In order to reduce the smell in the neighbourhood. The bund area is covered with sand, except the zone in front of the storage tank D2. Because the tank is leaning forward, it was not safe to enter the bund and in that area a lot of sludge was still present. This sludge containing a lot of sand is very viscous and has an average depth of 1 m.&lt;br&gt;From November 6th, 2005 the storage tank D2 is stabilized by 4 mayor cranes. These cranes that can support the total mass of the storage tank are placed on a service way just outside the bund.&lt;br&gt;After the stabilisation of the storage tank D2, two manholes of the storage tank were opened. Measurements indicated that the atmosphere in the storage tank was not explosive. They also saw that the floating roof had properly landed on his supports (legs). Nevertheless the company does not want operators to enter the storage tank to remove the sludge. For that reason they have ordered a robot to suck the sludge out of the storage tank.&lt;br&gt;In the next week a profound investigation of the soil will start. Firstly drillings until a depth of 2 to 3 m will be performed to measure the soil contamination. Afterwards drilling until a depth of 25 to 30 m will be performed to measure the stability of the soil at the terminal and in the surroundings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;
