In any case, a revision of technical regulations for hydrocarbons storage areas was foreseen. The main conclusions were the following:&lt;br&gt;1- fixed-roof tanks without weak seam for roof-to-shell attachment are very dangerous because in case of overpressure (which may occur during a fire) the collapse will happen at their bottom part (hence, the released product can spread around feeding the fire);&lt;br&gt;2- the application of cooling water is not very effective. Use of foam was very effective;&lt;br&gt;3- need for special suitable foams for polar hydrocarbons storage;&lt;br&gt;4- old regulations for storage installations were not adequate;&lt;br&gt;5- concrete dikes do not guarantee resistance for a sufficiently long period of time in case of fire and, hence, earth bund walls are preferable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"EmergencyResponce_Descr":["INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:&lt;br&gt;When the accident occurred, the local authorities were alarmed by telephone.

About 200 policemen were employed to control the road traffic, evacuate the personnel in the industrial area and transport the foam during the night. 25 people (13 of them were doctors) give medical help (18 beds for injured people and 11 operating rooms were prepared).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Official action taken - other official action: Cleaning of the plant when the authorities will allow it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastUser":{"UserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"Name":["MINERVA"],"Surname":["Administrator"],"IsVisibleSensibleData":[false]},"LastDate":["2017-07-11T15:59:38.73"],"ParentCompany":{},"Region":{},"Province":{},"City":{},"PostCode":{},"Concurrency":[0]},"LockedUserId":{},"LockedDate":{},"IsLocked":[false],"IsLockedByMe":[false],"LockedUser":{}},"AccidentProfile_Tab":{"ReportingAuthority":{},"ContactPerson":{},"Reasons":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Substances involved: greater than 5% of quantity in Column 3 of Annex I"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Injury to persons: &gt;= 1 fatalities, &gt;= 6 hospitalizing injuries etc."},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Immediate damage to the environment (according to Annex VI)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Damage to property: on-site &gt;2M &amp;euro;, off-site &gt; 0.5M &amp;euro;"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"Cross-border damage: transboundary accidents"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"Interesting for lessons learned."}],"AffectedCountries":{}},"AccidentDescription_Tab":{"AccidentDescription":{"DominoEffects":[false],"NatechEvents":[false],"TransboundaryEffects":[false],"Contractors":[false],"accTypeRelease":[0],"accTypeFire":[0],"accTypeExplosion":[0],"accTypeTransport":[0],"accTypeOther":{},"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastDate":["2017-07-11T16:00:08.688"],"Concurrency":[0],"Translation":{"VersionId":["c36ee9f7-6f92-fabd-96b3-9f41e109d2a3"],"LanguageId":["EN"],"AccidentDescription":["SAFETY SYSTEMS OR OPERATORS INTERVENTION:&lt;br&gt;Fire alarm by telephone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OTHER SYSTEMS INVOLVED AND OPERATING CONDITIONS:&lt;br&gt;Modification works at the electrical network of the welding posts was carrying out nearby the tanks. This may have had a possible relation with the explosion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ENVIRONMENTAL AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:&lt;br&gt;No wind when the fire occurred.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:&lt;br&gt;During modification works on non-energized electrical cables, at 13:05 a flash fire in the pumping station occurred followed after 1 minute by an explosion in the area. Ten minutes later, at 13:15 the first tank (250 m3 storage capacity for additives) exploded, and fired like a rocket up to about 200m, falling down 60 m away outside the storage area and spreading the fire to about 1/3 of the depot. The explosion of 5 other tanks followed. At 13:18 the local authorities were alarmed by telephone and, at 13:23,&amp;nbsp; a first control center was made up by the fire brigade. At 13:28 the fire brigade (42 men and 4 fire-trucks) arrived on-site and started the procedures to isolate the storage installation; at the same time arrived the first medical service (3 doctors with an ambulance). At 13:40 the traffic road in the area was interrupted and the personnel in the industrial area was evacuated. On-site there were 8 doctors, 5 ambulances and 2 re-animation vehicles. 18 beds for injured people were available. At 13:55, 117 policemen were present (200 at 14:20). At 14:10 the cooling of tanks (about 2,000m3/h by means of 25 monitors) was activated (it was carried out until the fire was extinguished). At 14:30, 200 policemen, 150 firemen, 20 doctors and nurses were present on-site. At 14:45, the Particular Emergency Plan was activated and the organization of emergency was under the direct control of the local Prefect. At 17:00 the fire spread all over the depot despite the water cooling. At 17:25 a first attempt to extinguishing the fire was carried out by means of 9 guns using 100,000 litres of foam. At 18:32 the explosion of another tank occurred and 6 firemen were wounded. The fire extended. The medical staff was reinforced. The explosion was due to boil-over of a tank containing 1,000 m3 of gasoil which created a fire-ball nearly 450m high and 200m wide. The fire spread to to the neighbouring storage area and to various buildings inside the installation. At that time, about 72,000 litres of foam were used. During the night 2 floating roof tanks in the near storage area caught fire. At 06:35 of June 3rd, a second attempt to extinguish the fire was carried out by means of 17 guns (2 of which with a large flow) using 200,000 litres of foam. The use of foam monitors with large capacity (6,000 litres/min) had proved really efficient. At 07:30 the fire in the storage area was extinguished. At 09:00 the fire was extinguished using 140,000 litres of foam during the second attempt (there was still a small leak at the bottom of a tank). At 13:48 the fire was completely extinguished. The cooling of the tanks continued for the following two days (4 and 5), using a limited amount of foam as a preventive measure. On June 6th-7th, a small quantity of foam was used, as a preventive measure, during the draining of some tanks. Polluted fire fighting water and unburned hydrocarbons that could be contained (about 10,000 m3 remained in the parks and drains) were collected and transferred by barges and wagons to a petroleum refinery for treatment.&lt;br&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;

establishment, 2 people working in the storage installation were killed and 8 (3 slightly) people injured in the fire. 6 firemen were injured by the explosion of a tank. Fire fighting operations required the intervention of more than 150\nfiremen for about 24 hours. About 200 policemen were employed to\ncontrol the road traffic, evacuate the personnel in the industrial area\nand transport the foam during the night. 25 people (13 of them were\ndoctors) give medical help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MATERIAL LOSS:&lt;br&gt;More than ten tanks in the storage area No 1 and 3 were completely destroyed (tanks No 6, 12, 14, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 59.1, 20 and 22) or damaged in such a way to make impossible their use. Also, the loading stations, the office building, some vehicles parked nearby and other components in the storage installation were destroyed. No data are available about the cost of the material damages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ECOLOGICAL HARM:&lt;br&gt;During the fire were released into the environment sulphur dioxide, lead compounds and particulate produced by the combustion of hydrocarbons. The amount of sulphur dioxide and lead compounds had been estimated, respectively, in 12 tonnes and 600 kg. No data are available about the amount of particulate released. In the document attached to the Original Report the observed environmental pollution was not significant. &lt;br&gt;When that document was prepared, the risk of pollution of underground waters due to the infiltration of hydrocarbons in the soil was not yet completely resolved and the control of the water bearing stratum had to carry out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MAP OF THE ACCIDENT AREA AND MAX.
