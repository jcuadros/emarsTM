The incident was caused by the ignition of an 81 mm HE M512A1 mortar round during the final packing operation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One side of the pallet assembly was filley with 54 projectiles of 81mm. The problem occured while closing the transport containers of the mortar rounds. The mortar rounds are transported in plastic containers that hold 3 mortar rounds in seperate tubes. The operator experienced difficulties in loading the round into the containers and closing the container caps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mortar round sometimes protruded more than normal from the plastic container and this made it more difficult to fit the retaining cap, to rotate it and to align it correctly. A gap remained between the container and the cap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The operator found that striking the retaining cap of the container with a mallet was enough to align it and to allow the cap to be locked in position. According to the operator, the incident occurred when he struck the remaining cap with a mallet due to it being difficult to align and rotate.&lt;br&gt;This was not the first time that the operator used the mallet to close the cap. One of the two operators at the packing operation had done the loading operation before but could not be considerd highly experienced since he was drafted in to performe this operation from another area of the site (machining).&lt;br&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to
