The site of the explosion was a storage tank, the purpose of which is a safety drainage of supporting medium from the production line. The storage tank contains two phases - acidic (that means sulphuric acid in the concentration of 70-80 %) and organic (nitrobenzene). Both phases normally contain dissolved nitrophenols and dinitrobenzene in concentrations of up to hundreds of mg/kg. The investigation found that the most probable course of events was as follows: The first factor was the climatic conditions, which lead to the freezing of the route of the waste condensate from the technological steam heating, followed by the penetration of the condensate from the overfilled condenser through the barometric closure into the drainage storage tank with the sulphuric acid. Here, as a consequence of the dissolving temperature on the interface of the acid and organic phase, the temperature gradually increased accompanied by other bypassing exothermic reactions (thermal decomposition of less stable nitrophenols and dinitrobenzene). These reactions increased the temperature on the interface up to the decomposition temperature of nitrobenzene. Thermal decomposition of nitrobenzene was accompanied by a rupture of the storage tank - explosion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An investigation team was appointed in accordance with the operational guidelines of BC MCHZ - Instruction M2 - 26150.doc \"Investigation of extraordinary events\". Results of the investigation are summarized in the report \"Accident of the adiabetic line of the production plant of nitrobenzene\" event.No.1/2003/VS3 from 27.1.2003. Following the comments to A1.&lt;br&gt;Immediately after the explosion, the JHZS BC MCHZ arrived on the scene, followed by other components of IZS. At the same time, the instruction was issued to close the terminal of the rain collector that drains the water to the Odra (remote controlled armature). Information from other interested persons, including technical steps, followed in accordance with the internal emergency plan of BC MCHZ. The explosion of the storage tank in the bottom part of the steel panel construction of the adiabatic line caused damage to the technological constructions of the line in the floors above. There was no fire during the explosion and nobody was injured. The liquid content of the storage tank, partially also in the form of explosion products, was sent flying and most of the liquid phase landed in the retention tank under the line, while a small part fell on the consolidated road, and approx. 1m3 fell on the surrounding snow. The liquid phase froze on the road and snow, and it was possible to clean it up after mixing with sawdust. The contaminated material was deposited on a protected surface in the area BC MCHZ. At the same time an aerosol cloud composed from soot and fine drops of acids formed. Most of the aerosol sedimented in the inner part of the area, while a part was blown to the south and southwest of the plant. The aerosol also hit a high-tension cable- inlet insulators to BC MCHZ, and made them scintillate. They had to be cleaned, leading to a temporary cut in the supply of electricity. Debris was spread up to 90m with one piece (a tube) being found at a distance of 300 m - on the opposite bank of the Odra river. The pressure wave broke windows in the surroundings and damaged the guttering of roofs of the neighbouring objects. &lt;br&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;
