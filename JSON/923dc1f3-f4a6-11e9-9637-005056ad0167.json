The fire grew very quickly. In order to avoid secondary incidents, the Seveso establishment staff, with the help of the fire brigade, removed containers of phosphorus pentasulphide (a flammable product, reacting violently with water, generating hydrogen sulphide and phosphoric acid) to a safe distance. As the situation progressed, large bulk containers stored outdoors started melting and firemen had to deal with the release of liquid fuels. After 2 hours of use, the site’s fire water reservoir (1,860 m³) was empty. It took 5 hours to arrange for water to be pumped directly from the River Seine. The prefect of the department triggered the special intervention plan at around 5.30 a.m. and ordered the confinement of an area within a 500-metre perimeter. The fire, which spread over approximately 3.7 hectares, was brought under control after an intervention of 13 hours. Altogether 276 firemen from several departments, private resources from other companies and 96 m³ of foam were mobilised to fight the fire.&lt;/p&gt;"],"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["6799492a-0079-4d05-aad1-8f4dce857337"],"LastUser":{"UserId":["6799492a-0079-4d05-aad1-8f4dce857337"],"Name":["Enrico"],"Surname":["GUAGNINI"],"IsVisibleSensibleData":[false]},"LastDate":["2020-10-05T17:06:15.887"],"ParentCompany":{},"Region":{},"Province":{},"City":{},"PostCode":{},"Concurrency":[0]},"LockedUserId":{},"LockedDate":{},"IsLocked":[false],"IsLockedByMe":[false],"LockedUser":{}},"AccidentProfile_Tab":{"ReportingAuthority":{},"ContactPerson":{},"Reasons":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Substances involved: greater than 5% of quantity in Column 3 of Annex I"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Injury to persons: &gt;= 1 fatalities, &gt;= 6 hospitalizing injuries etc."},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Immediate damage to the environment (according to Annex VI)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Damage to property: on-site &gt;2M &amp;euro;, off-site &gt; 0.5M &amp;euro;"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"Cross-border damage: transboundary accidents"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"Interesting for lessons learned."}],"AffectedCountries":{}},"AccidentDescription_Tab":{"AccidentDescription":{"DominoEffects":[true],"NatechEvents":[false],"TransboundaryEffects":[true],"Contractors":[false],"accTypeRelease":[0],"accTypeFire":[0],"accTypeExplosion":[0],"accTypeTransport":[0],"accTypeOther":{},"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["6799492a-0079-4d05-aad1-8f4dce857337"],"LastDate":["2020-10-05T17:06:15.887"],"Concurrency":[0],"Translation":{"VersionId":["305fb586-53d6-4164-b492-5f8c93790c91"],"LanguageId":["EN"],"AccidentDescription":["&lt;p&gt;There was a fire in a storage area for packaged products (200-litre drums, 1,000-litre intermediate bulk containers IBC, pallets) in a plant producing additives for oils and lubricants, classified as an ‘upper-tier Seveso establishment’.

A judicial investigation and an administrative inquiry are still under way to determine, in particular, where the fire started: whether at the Seveso site or at a neighbouring storage company. Two neighbouring industrial sites suffered damage (a waste treatment plant and a warehousing company). A total of 9,511 tonnes of products were burned in the fire (5,253 tonnes of products on the Seveso site and 4,258 tonnes in neighbouring warehouses). A significant plume of smoke outside the site (22 km long and 6 km wide) travelled as far as the Rouen city centre, the north of France and was observed in Belgium and the Netherlands. Local residents experienced a nauseating stench, with some of them reporting throat irritation, a headaches and vomiting.

A plume of black fumes 22 km long and 6 km wide, led to ash falling at distances of more than 100 km along with strong odours. &lt;br /&gt;During the first two days, 237 schools in 12 municipalities downwind of the establishment were closed and there were 254 hospital emergency presentations and 9 hospital admissions linked to the fire, though no-one was seriously injured. Restrictions were imposed on the consumption of agricultural products from 215 municipalities and lifted in full on 18 October.&lt;br /&gt;Starting on the morning when the fire broke out, samples (air, ash/deposits) were taken by the fire brigade, the approved observatory for air-quality monitoring and information and private laboratories designated by the State. The samples were supplemented by analyses of the various matrices (air, surface water, supply of drinking water, soil and vegetation, food matrices) to ensure their compatibility with current and medium-term use.
