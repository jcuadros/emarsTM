Reportable due to quantity released: 750000 cubic metres of gas (weight approx 94 tonnes,c. 50% of top tier quantity)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At approximately 11.30 am on Monday 9 August 1999 the energy distribution control (EDC) contacted Redcar blast furnace (RBF) control room and reported a dip in gas make from the furnace.&amp;nbsp; No alarms were reported from RBF and the gas make appeared to return&lt;br&gt;to normal.&amp;nbsp; Shortly afterwards however carbon monoxide alarms went off in the power station (range of CO levels, 40-80 ppm on turbine floor) and it was noticed that the gas make had not returned to its normal level.&amp;nbsp; A check was made of the gas line to determine the source of the gas leak.&amp;nbsp; It was reported that the leak was from the ERT inlet valve and the ERT was tripped.&amp;nbsp; When it came off line the full flow of the blast furnace gas was directed down the clean gas main.&amp;nbsp; In fact the leak was from the demister plate valve, this increased the leak and also, because of the pressure build up in the system caused a pressure sensor situated upstream of the demister plate vAlve to trip at 170mbarg so opening flare stack leg A and allowing the contents of the gas holder to escape to the flare stack.&amp;nbsp; The flare stack was not lit (see below) and the gas was released unflared.&amp;nbsp; Levels of carbon monoxide of 100ppm were recorded around the ramp at no 1 slag pit.&amp;nbsp; At around the time that the ERT was tripped it was noticed that the leak was actually from the demister plate valve and blowing across the top of the ERT building then towards the bag filter house and towards the power station.&amp;nbsp; Part of the cast-house floor of the blast furnace were within the path of the gas.&amp;nbsp; Personnel were evacuated from the cast-house floor of the furnace however casting was in progress and some personnel were required to complete the cast before the plant could be made safe.&amp;nbsp; These personnel were given Draeger comopac carbon monoxide monitors and returned to the casthouse to complete the cast.&amp;nbsp; In the meantime the furnace was taken off blast to reduce the flow of gas.&amp;nbsp; It was reported that the highest levels of gas (200ppm) were found on the rocker bay below the cast house floor.&amp;nbsp; During the release the alarms in the ERT building were set off by carbon monoxide, these are set to go off at 2000ppm.&amp;nbsp; The blast furnace was brought off-blast, an operation which took some time and necessitated the opening of the bleeder valves at the top of the furnace which introduced another release source for the gas during the incident.&amp;nbsp; The u-seal between the blast furnace and the clean gas main was put into place at around 12:20 and the incident declared closed at 13:14 although the blast furnace had not been completely brought off blast at this time.&amp;nbsp; Theexact amount of gas released during the incident is unknown although a British Steel calculation estimates that 130 tonnes were lost through the demister plate valve and 77 tonnes from the gasholder unflared through the flare stack (the gas holder was estimated to be 40% full at the time of the incident).&amp;nbsp;

There are a number of parts of this system which are of relevance &lt;br&gt;to this incident;&amp;nbsp; Blast furnace gas formed during furnace operation is directed from the blast furnace through the demister and&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;into the clean gas system.&amp;nbsp; Once through the demister there are two potential routes;through the energy recovery turbine(ERT) or directly through to the gas holder or flarestack past PIV 7 the demister plate valve.&amp;nbsp; Under normal operation the valve immediately upstream to PIV 7 is closed and the normal flow is through the ERT.&amp;nbsp; The gasholder has a capacity of 150000 cubic metres (117 tonnes) of blast furnace gas, at the time of the incident the gas holder was about 40% full.&amp;nbsp; There is a flarestack associated with the system, this was manufactured by Airoil-Flaregas, Fleets Corner, Poole, Dorset BH17 0LA.&amp;nbsp; The flare system was installed and commissioned in early 1996.&amp;nbsp; There are three legs to the flare which are each fitted with 6 pilots lit by propane.&amp;nbsp; Operation of the flarestack is initiated by a number of pressure switches which act to open the route to the flarestack, one of these pressure switches is located between the isolation valve after the demister and PIV7.&amp;nbsp; The demister plate valve is 3.5m in diameter and is a normally open valve which is used to isolate the downstream part of the clean gas system when the furnace is off-blast, it is not an emergency shut-off valve.&amp;nbsp;

Valve did not fully close and seal blown off by closing into full gas flow, leak occurred through annulus of valve.  System of work in place where hydraulics isolated and locked off when valve in open position had not been followed and electrical fault led to valve closing.  Blast furnace shut down but residual pressure in gas holder led to continuation of release, some gas flared but c.750,000 cubic metres lost via valve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The site is a new\nentrant COMAH top-tier site and little previous work has been done to\nevaluate the managemnet system in place to prevent and mitigate\npotential major accidents. The assessments above are from information\nreceived during the investigation into the release. These aspects will\nbe considered in more detail during inspection as part of the\ninspection plan. No entry written.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The investigation involved two main areas of interest, the demister\nplate valve itself and the flare system, these are dealt with\nseparately below.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\na)&amp;nbsp; Initial investigations showed that the reason the demister plate\nvalve had shut was because of an electrical short circuit between\nrelays 28767 the local emergency stop and 28777 the local closed push\nbutton relay in the demister plate valve location box.&amp;nbsp; This box had\nbeen designed to IP65 however a compression joint in one of the top\nglands had been incorrectly fitted so that part of the steel wire\narmouring of the cable was above the level of the seal hence water\ningress was possible.&amp;nbsp; This short in itself however should not have\nbeen sufficient to cause the closure of the plate valve as British\nSteel procedures required physical isolations to be fitted to the\nelectrical input to the local box together with the electrical and\nmanual operation of the plate valve clamps situated in the hydraulic\nshed below the plate valve.&amp;nbsp; None of these three isolations&amp;nbsp; were\nfitted at the time of the incident.&amp;nbsp; There are a number of procedures\non TEMS (Total Engineering Management System) which relate to\noperations on the demister plate valve.&amp;nbsp; Of these, Job Safety Procedure\nJFP607 refers to operation of the plate valve during shutdowns and\nincludes details on both closing and opening the valve.&amp;nbsp; The procedure\ndetails the need to isolate the valve electrical and hydraulic systems\nto prevent unauthorised valve operations.&amp;nbsp; The isolations referred to\nin JFP607 for the valve when in the open position are detailed in\nisolation no.IF4494,these are; the gas plant isolation valve hydraulic\nhouse below the valve at the north end of the demister); and the gas\nplant isolation valve electric actuator on the platform adjacent to the\ngoggle valve actuator in the gas main.&amp;nbsp; When the valve is in the closed\nposition there is an additional electrical isolation in the switch\nhouse.&amp;nbsp; The isolations are made by way of isolocks on the local\nisolators which are secured by an EBI lock.&amp;nbsp; There is a master key\nwhich fits all EBI locks, this is kept in a key cabinet in the RBF\ncontrol room and issued via a signing out book.&amp;nbsp; The key to the key\ncabinet is kept to the side of the communications panel in the control\nroom and is easily accessible.&amp;nbsp; The last shutdown which required\nclosing of the demister plate valve was carried out at the end of\nJune.&amp;nbsp; There are no records in the key signing out book between 30 June\nand 9 August when, following the release the isolocks and EBI locks\nwere observed to be lying on the windowsill in the hydraulic house\nbelow the valve at the north end of the demister.&amp;nbsp; In 1996 and 1997 a\nquality improvement programme (QIP) was initiated which looked at all\naspects of operation of the plate and goggle valves in the clean gas\nmain.&amp;nbsp; The minutes of the meetings are attached.&amp;nbsp; Issues raised during\nthe QIP included the identification of the valves (as problems had been\nencountered where personnel meant different valves when that used a\nparticular number) and safe operation of the valves.&amp;nbsp; Concern was\nexpressed about the level of isolation of plate valves as the manual\nhydraulic override was not isolated.&amp;nbsp; A was raised in which it was\nstated that the actuation of a plate valve during furnace operation\ncould result in a large release of gas and recommended the isolation of\nthe manual hydraulic clamp release on the plate valves.&amp;nbsp; Following the\nplate valve QIP a committee was set up to look at the implications of\nCOMAH for the blast furnace.&amp;nbsp; During a meeting on 23rd July 1997 a list\nof the top ten scenarios for major accidents occurring on RBF were\npresented, failed operation of plate valve PIV7 was included on this\nlist.&amp;nbsp; In addition to the procedures for safe operation of the plate\nvalve, TEMS holds routines for the inspection of plate valves by both\nelectrical and mechanical inspectors.&amp;nbsp; There are separate electrical\nand mechanical routines for all plate valves, some examples are\nattached.&amp;nbsp; Those for electrical inspections are typically on a two to\nfour week frequency and include a reference to checking that isolations\nare in place.&amp;nbsp; In the case of PIV7 however the reference to check that\nthe isolation was in place was added after the incident on 9th August\nso prior to the incident there was no requirement for electrical\ninspectors to carry out checks that the isolations were in place on\neither the electrical junction box adjacent to the demister plate valve\nor in the hydraulic house despite there being requirements to check\nthese isolations on other plate valves.&amp;nbsp; The schedules for mechanical\ninspections for the plate valves are similar to those for the\nelectrical inspections and again there are no instructions on the job\nfor PIV7 to check isolations are in place whereas these are present on\nsome of the job schedules for other plate valves.&amp;nbsp; Two routine\nelectrical inspections of the plate valve were carried out between the\nshutdown at the end June and the gas release but TEMS contains no\ncomments as to the presence or otherwise of the isolations at these\ninspections.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\nb) Originally it was thought that the flare had ignited and the gas\nfrom the gas-holder had been flared, it soon became apparent however\nthat this was not the case and that raw gas was released from the flare\nstack during the incident.&amp;nbsp; Operation of the flare stack can be\ninitiated manually or by the tripping of one or more of five pressure\nswitches situated as shown in the attached diagram.&amp;nbsp; Switches 1 and 2\nare set to trip at 173mbar and open flare leg A, switch 3 is set at\n80mbar and opens legs A, switch 4 is set at 85mbar and opens leg B and\nswitch 5 is set at 95mbar and opens leg C.&amp;nbsp; In addition there is a\npressure transmitter which ties in with the gas holder level system and\nacts to open leg C.&amp;nbsp; The flare is not normally lit but lights by means\nof an air and propane ignition system when a leg opens.&amp;nbsp; During the\nincident on 9th August, pressure switch 2 tripped due to a build up of\nblast furnace gas around the demister plate valve and so it was leg A\nwhich opened.&amp;nbsp; At the time of the incident the flare was in an alarm\nmode and so there was no ignition when the flare was opened.&amp;nbsp; The flare\nhad been in alarm since at least 1st August (there were no records\navailable prior to this date but no action had been taken to reset the\nflare which was done by manually operating a button at the base of the\nflare stack.&amp;nbsp; Visual display of the alarm is given in the control room\nat RBF, when the alarm comes in there is an audible alarm and a\nflashing light however once accepted the audible is canceled and the\nlight remains on but does not flash.&amp;nbsp; It is thought that the contents\nof the gas holder were lost through the flare in around 7 minutes.&amp;nbsp;\nDuring the investigation into the failure of the flare system to ignite\nduring the incident it was discovered that in fact none of the flare\nlegs was operable and consideration was given to the service of a COMAH\nProhibition Notice however action to restore temporary propane\nsuppllies to the flare legs brought the flare back into use until\nrepairs were carried out.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;"],"Other":[""]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment
