A noise was heard by the shift personnel who then located the leak. The shift supervisor and an operator immediately put on personal air breathing apparatuses and went where the leakage occurred. The section of the circuit containing the leaking valve was isolated on the upstream by stopping the feeding pump and closing the block valve at the exchanger inlet and on the downstream by closing the first block valve after the exchanger outlet. The valve to the vacuum system was immediately opened to evacuate the product contained in the isolated section to the scrubber system. The plant was shut-down. Internal, intercompanies and fire department emergency plans were put into action. Neighbouring plants, fire department and hospital of Salreu were alerted. At 05:14 the leak was stopped.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The accident occurred in the feeding circuit of the 70% phosgene solution in monochlorobenzene of a polymeric isocyanate production plant in an organic chemical industry. The plant is part of a chemical industry complex (4 factories) sited in a plane forest area, 1 km away from some houses and 3 km away from the nearest village.The polymeric isocyanate production used as starting materials: anyline, formaldehyde, hydrogen chloride, sodium hydroxide and carbonium chloride. The operating conditions in the feeding section of the 70% phosgene solution in monochlorobenzene were: pressure= 40 Bar and temperature= 135°C. At 05:10 the rupture of a purge valve, installed at the outlet of a heat exchanger for heating the phosgene solution, caused the release of a 70% phosgene solution in monochlorobenzene. A noise was heard by the shift personnel who then located the leak. The shift supervisor and an operator immediately put on personal air breathing apparatuses and went where the leakage occurred. The section of the circuit containing the leaking valve was isolated on the upstream by stopping the feeding pump and closing the block valve at the exchanger inlet and on the downstream by closing the first block valve after the exchanger outlet. The valve to the vacuum system was immediately opened to evacuate the product contained in the isolated section to the scrubber system. The plant was shut-down. Internal, intercompanies and fire department emergency plans were put into action. Neighbouring plants, fire department and hospital of Salreu were alerted. At 05:14 the leak was stopped (about 15 minutes after the leakage started). The four bolts fractured due to chloride stress cracking corrosion. There is a possibility (not fully clear) that there was hydrogen embrittlement also. The cracking corrosion occurred due to an inadequate component design.&lt;br&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;
