It has been reported that the premises of Fisipe have been\nreached ( a neighbouring installation to Adubos de Portugal) at approx.\n300 - 350 m (metres) from the reactor (prevailing direction N and NE).\nFootnote: The distance of the reactor to the limits of the installation\nis of approx. 150 m and the distance to the first houses is of 200 m\n(direction south).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People - Remarks: &lt;br&gt;The projection of refractory tiles and of materials contained in the reactor lasted only a short time. When the emergency personnel arrived, the explosions (deflagrations) and the projection of materials had already stopped.\n- One person was slightly injured by the projection of tiles, but had not to be hospitalised.\n- One person was slightly injured during the fire fighting operation, but had not to be hospitalised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ecological harm - Remarks: &lt;br&gt;According to the information supplied by the company there are neither ecological damages (consequences) nor have toxic or flammables substances been released (emitted).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Material loss - Remarks: &lt;br&gt;The losses consequent to emergency response, to clean-up and to remediation are included in the material losses (approx 200,000 euros)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Disruption of community life: &lt;br&gt;Neither point a) nor point b) were threatened.\nThe civil governor of the district of Setubal stayed on place in order to maintain the government informed.
