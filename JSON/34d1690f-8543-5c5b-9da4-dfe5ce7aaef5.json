The steam was turned off and the single automated isolation valve to the pump was closed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On 25 July work began to replace the pump. The line was broken to remove the pump. The maintenance technician then went to collect a new part from the stores leaving the work site unattended. No additional isolation was provided.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whilst the technician was away from the work site molten PT began to flow from the pipe over filling the spill bund and spreading across the site. It appears that the valve had failed or was not closed. In addition, the PT had not solidified as anticipated - it is likely that this was due to the head of available liquid in the storage tank and the high ambient temperature on the day of the incident.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are 2 principle causes for this incident. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Firstly, the single automated isolation valve was open at the time of the release although it appears that it had been closed before the work began. At present, the nature of this failure is not clear. The clean up exercise continues and an assessment of the valve will be made when access is available.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Secondly, the level of isolation provided was inadequate.&amp;nbsp; The design of the plant means that there is only one automatic valve between the storage tank and the pump. Reliance was placed on the single closed valve and the nature of the product i.e. that its melting point is 44°C.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A tank containing 30 tonnes of molten para-toluidine at 55 degrees C\n(melting point 44 degrees C) had a faulty pump connected to the bottom\nrun-off line. A fitter removed the main body of the pump for repair.\nFor physical isolation of the pump housing, the fitter relied on a\nsingle valve and a frozen plug of para-toluidine behind the valve, as\nthe steam had been removed from the tracing to this line, to seal the\ncontents. Shortly after the fitter left, the tank contents were\nreleased due to the failure of this isolation. The para-toluidine\noverflowed the bund wall and spread over the tank farm, contaminating a\nwide area with a solid layer of toxic material.
