B of 16 September 2013, 'Handling and use of flammable raw materials H225 H226 — R10 and R11 in RS1').\nThe company is currently looking into a new, fixed filling system for flammable raw materials, in a closed cycle and/or a nitrogen atmosphere, from mobile containers, so as to rule out the possibility of inappropriate operations.\nThe Commission points out that the risk related to electrostatic charges when transferring products from small containers tends to be underestimated.

The product was transferred in an open cycle.\nWhen about 10-15 litres were left in the fourth barrel and the barrel was to be emptied completely, tipping the barrel to provide greater depth, and presumably in the subsequent phase of removal of the filling lance, the dimethyl carbonate vapours in the barrel itself ignited, causing the barrel to explode, the bottom to become detached and the consequent immediate ignition of all the product, with an impact area limited to the sampling point (around two metres). The first operator, who was responsible for handling the flammable products, was hit by burning dimethyl carbonate (presumably a flash fire) and sustained burns to much of his body.
