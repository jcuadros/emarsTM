The fact that the tank contained flammable material emerged several times, but the Operator did not take the opportunity to train staff and update their systems. Any change of plant operation should be critically risk assessed, adequately controlled and relevant systems updated accordingly, to ensure the significance of a newly generated hazard is not lost over time. This is particularly important where hazardous waste streams are recycled back into the process.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Other opportunities to prevent the explosion were also missed. Two days before the incident, a gas test indicated a potentially explosive atmosphere within the tank, but this information was either not shared or acted upon by those planning or carrying out the job. Companies should reflect upon this failure and review their own systems to ensure that they provide training and arrangements for the recording and communication of important safety-critical information.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This incident clearly demonstrates that safety management systems are only effective when robustly audited, monitored and enforced. Safety arrangements that have been allowed to degrade over time become weak and ineffective. Whilst providing an illusion of safety and risk control, as seen in this case, ineffective systems do not remain strong enough to prevent real harm occurring. This prosecution serves as a reminder to those with a responsibility for employees and contractors to actively monitor their safety management system arrangements and ensure they are effective in keeping workers safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Broader lessons&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The law requires that companies should possess clear and accurate information regarding hazardous material stored within tanks. Furthermore, all employees and contractors involved in planning and maintenance activities on tanks should know and understand the dangers presented by the materials inside. This should include rigorous analysis (including sampling when appropriate) of the hazards of all constituents remaining within the tank prior to starting removal work. Section 2.5 of the Energy Institute’s Model Code of Safe Practice Part 16: Guidance on Tank Cleaning contains detailed information regarding pre-cleaning checks and inspections.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A risk assessment and the establishment of clear work instructions for any tank cleaning operation should be conducted by trained and competent staff.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To organise the work as safely as possible, the planning and preparation work should be based on knowledge of the hazardous tank contents, combined with a good understanding of and adherence to the published HSE guidance and specific tank cleaning standards, for example the Energy Institute’s Model Code of Safe Practice Part 16: Tank Cleaning Safety Code.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;HSE believe there are some clear lessons to be learned for all businesses in relation to safety management systems. Our recommendations are set out below.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; Process safety performance indicators&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Effective management of major hazards requires a proactive approach to risk management. Information to confirm that critical systems are operating as intended is essential. Carefully chosen process safety performance indicators can monitor the status of key systems, providing assurance that major hazard risks are under control or an early warning, should controls deteriorate. HSE publication HSG254 Developing process safety indicators: A step-by-step guide for chemical and major hazard industries contains practical information.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;2. Process modification and the management of change&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Process modifications, in this case converting the ARU from an open to a closed system, should not be undertaken without having carried out a safety, engineering and technical review. Risk assessment should then identify what hazards have been created by the change that may affect plant or personnel safety, and what action can be implemented to reduce or eliminate the risk.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Changes may affect other parts of the plant which may be remote from the source of the change. Therefore, all parts of the plant should be considered in undertaking hazard identification and risk assessments. Additional hazards that may be introduced which need to be considered include fire, explosion and loss of containment. Further guidance can be found within HSE publication L111 The Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations 2015: Guidance on Regulations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3. Safety-critical communications&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A communications protocol should be developed and embedded within the workplace for the transmission of safety-critical information. In this case the %LEL reading that was taken from the top of the tank on 31 May 2011. For effective communication, information to be shared should be conveyed through more than one medium, for example oral and written, combined with clarification and confirmation offered by the recipient. Clearly this relies upon employers ensuring that those involved in a task understand what constitutes safety-critical information. HSE publication HSG48 Reducing error and influencing behaviour contains relevant guidance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;4. Competence management systems&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hazard identification, risk assessments and risk controls are all essential elements in ensuring that effective workplace precautions are implemented. Systems need to be in place to ensure that those carrying out these tasks are trained and competent, and that their work is monitored by competent managers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Employers should ensure that an effective competence management system is in place, so that staff are adequately trained and competent to undertake the tasks for which they are responsible. This should include arrangements for limiting staff engagement in complex safety-critical activities, when deputising for senior colleagues. The Office of Rail and Road publication Developing and maintaining staff competence provides useful guidance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;5.&amp;nbsp; Management of contractors&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The law requires that companies should possess clear and accurate information regarding hazardous material stored within tanks. Furthermore, all employees and contractors involved in planning and maintenance activities on tanks should know and understand the dangers presented by the materials inside. This should include rigorous analysis (including sampling when appropriate) of the hazards of all constituents remaining within the tank prior to starting removal work. Section 2.5 of the Energy Institute’s Model Code of Safe Practice Part 16: Guidance on Tank Cleaning contains detailed information regarding pre-cleaning checks and inspections.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Companies engaged in the use of contractors should assume the role of an ‘intelligent customer’, rather than relying solely upon the contractor’s knowledge and experience. An intelligent customer will establish the regulatory and industry standards to which the contractor is expected to conform. The company will use this information to supervise the contractor’s performance and verify the adequacy of work carried out on its behalf. The Office of Nuclear Regulation guide Licensee Core Safety and Intelligent Customer Capabilities provides useful information.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;6.&amp;nbsp; Contractor competence&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Contracting companies should understand HSE legislation, guidance and industrial standards relevant to their work activities. Technical requirements associated with topic-specific guidance, such as tank cleaning, should form a critical part of safety management systems. This is particularly important in relation to risk assessment, established systems of work, the procurement of work equipment, training and competence assessment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/dir&gt;&lt;/dir&gt;&lt;/dir&gt;"],"EmergencyResponce_Descr":["&lt;p&gt;The fire was brought under control using on-site firefighting staff and equipment.

Production increased over time, to the point that output had reached 220,000 bpd at the time of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The crude oil is processed to generate predominantly petrol and diesel products, which is sold worldwide. The refinery’s corporate ownership has changed over the years. Historically the establishment has had several owners and in 2011,&amp;nbsp;at the time of the&amp;nbsp;incident,&amp;nbsp;was up for sale. The current Operators&amp;nbsp;purchased&amp;nbsp;the establishment in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In 2011 the refinery employed 543 workers on site, with additional support provided by approximately 700 contractors. The contractors involved&amp;nbsp;employed 55 staff.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/dir&gt;&lt;/dir&gt;&lt;/dir&gt;"],"Installation_Description":["&lt;dir&gt;&lt;dir&gt;&lt;dir&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000000\"&gt;The amine regeneration unit (ARU)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000000\"&gt;Crude oil consists predominantly of hydrocarbon compounds but also contains hydrogen sulphide (H2S) which is toxic and must be removed. H2S is separated from crude oil and other petroleum products by a process involving diethanolamine. This chemical is subsequently treated to remove the entrained H2S and then recycled for re-use. The processing and recycling of diethanolamine takes place within the amine regeneration unit (ARU).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000000\"&gt;The ARU was at the centre of the incident and the process is briefly summarised in this section and schematically. The ARU supplies diethanolamine to nine scrubbing units located across the refinery. The scrubbing of petroleum products involves combining diethanolamine (amine) and petroleum products under slight pressure, in order to remove hydrogen sulphide from the petroleum fraction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000000\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000000\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000000\"&gt;Successful scrubbing relies upon the strong affinity between amine solution and hydrogen sulphide. Hydrogen sulphide chemically combines with the amine in the scrubbers to form ‘rich’ amine that &lt;span style=\"color: #000000\"&gt;is pumped back to the ARU. There, rich amine is heated with steam in a regeneration column to remove and separate out hydrogen sulphide. The resulting sulphide-free amine solution is pumped from the bottom of the regenerator column back to the amine running tank, where it is stored temporarily, before being pumped out for use once again in the refinery scrubbers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/dir&gt;&lt;/dir&gt;&lt;/dir&gt;&lt;dir&gt;&lt;dir&gt;&lt;dir&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000000\"&gt;During scrubbing, the amine not only binds hydrogen sulphide but also collects up some of the hydrocarbon to which it has been exposed. The entrained hydrocarbon then returns with the rich amine to the ARU ‘surge drum’. In this vessel, hydrocarbon would separate, floating above the aqueous amine. An internal weir system was used to skim off the upper hydrocarbon layer, which was subsequently routed to the ARU flare knock-out drum.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000000\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000000\"&gt;The ARU flare drum received light hydrocarbon material from various sources, not just the ARU. Much of this hydrocarbon would, as intended, evaporate and pass to the refinery flare system. The residue, which included a variety of hydrocarbons and some contaminated amine, would accumulate in the lower section of the flare drum, called the ‘boot’. Originally, this residue would be automatically pumped to a remote crude oil slops system elsewhere on the refinery, or a dedicated slops separation tank on the ARU plot. However, in 1998 the decision was made to operate the ARU as a ‘closed system’, which meant the redirection and automated pumping of flare drum residue ultimately into the amine running tank.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000000\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000000\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000000\"&gt;As an important consequence of this change, any liquid hydrocarbon transferred to the ARU flare drum as a result of normal ARU operation (or events elsewhere on the refinery) was retained on the unit and eventually accumulated within the ARU running tank 17T302.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/dir&gt;&lt;/dir&gt;&lt;/dir&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;"],"Other":[""]}},"SiteStorageMajors":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"process-associated (stockholding, etc. on-site of manufacture)","EquipmentType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"distribution-associated (not on-site of manufacture)","EquipmentType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"other","EquipmentType":{"EqType_ID":7,"Category":"process","Description":"reaction vessel;

For example, the procedure entitled ‘&lt;em&gt;Action to take on LPG getting in to the ARU/SRU Flare Drum&lt;/em&gt;’, designed to prevent LPG entering the running tank, was not fit for purpose and routinely ignored.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000000\"&gt;Inadequate risk review&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000000\"&gt;Following the decision in 1998 to operate the ARU as a closed system, there were a number of events that should have triggered a review of the unit risk assessment, in particular the need for repeated removal of excess light hydrocarbon material that had accumulated within the running tank.
