The issue of a series of general guidelines for installations producing or handling the same product or similar substances will be studied.&lt;br&gt;The following conclusions were drawn from the accident:&lt;br&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The use of the transit area as a storage area appears to be negligent with regards to safety and was worsened by the following factors:&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Significant amounts (54 tons/day before the accident) of product stored in a small area practically exposed to atmospheric conditions.&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The product safety sheet indicates that exposing the product to humidity and temperatures above 40°C should be avoided&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Irregular storage duration: three months.&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Lack of specific fire fighting equipment for the area.&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Design of the area, the cable racks were suspended at a height of 7 meters from the ground but the piles of product reached a height of 3.5 meters.&lt;br&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Operative procedures and safety management system. Unsafe practices:&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Failure to recover the spilled product with the intention to postpone the operation to the next day.&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Leaving a fork lift truck near the big bags with the risk associated to the presence of fuel.&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;There were no written procedures on the measures to be taken in case of the rupture of a bag and product spill, although it appears that the workers knew that they had to be careful during product recovery and that contaminated products had to be sent for disposal.&lt;br&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;According to the workers bag ruptures were frequent. Moreover they all report&amp;nbsp; having seen sodium dichlorisocyanurate react with trichlorocyanuric acid (TCCA) with fuel or water in the processing area. Consequently although risks were known the safety measures taken were not sufficiently effective.&lt;br&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The installation did not comply with the regulations set out by the current legislation according to the results of the inspections foreseen for Major Accident Hazard installations, although the non-compliance did not concern classified substances. Although the operator was still within the terms for the corrective measures set out following the inspection, but not all of them, it has to be said that this does not exempt the operator from the exclusive responsibility with regards to the non-compliance with the applicable regulations as from the date these regulations were implemented in Spanish law.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measures to mitigate consequences:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; The lack of an extinguishing water system independent of the process, although not obligatory, associated with the failure of the electric cable system led to the plant not being able to respond to the emergency&amp;nbsp; with its own means, having&amp;nbsp; to depend completely on external emergency response services and fire brigades.&lt;br&gt;Alternative systems are being studied.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Useful references:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The medical services reported that no patients were treated for the effects of the toxic cloud but complaints concerning irritation to eyes and respiratory tract were received by local police officers of adjacent municipalities and by the emergency number 112. This leads us to suppose that the smoke cloud was at such a height not to affect the population of the rural area nearest to the plant, in which there are farm buildings. When the smoke cooled down and reached the ground it was sufficiently diluted not to cause any severe health consequences to people.&lt;br&gt;The fact that the population living in the vicinity was alerted and requested to take shelter in their homes and to close doors and windows certainly contributed to reducing the consequences of this event.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"],"EmergencyResponce_Descr":["&lt;p&gt;The population affected sheltered-in-place.&lt;br&gt;On-site an attempt was made to control the fire with on-site extinguishing equipment, the on-site emergency plan was activated and external assistance was requested.

The worker reached the area with a portable extinguisher and gas mask and found two rows of 1 tonne bags containing anhydrous sodium dichlorisocyanurate on the extreme left of the area and placed at a distance of 50 cm from each other. He could distinguish two piles of big bags in the front and another two big bags on the ground a bit more to the right. He declared that he could see smoke rising from the wooden pallet placed under the bag pile and the bottom bag on the right. He emptied the portable extinguisher, found another two and emptied them too but could not stop the combustion process and smoke development.&lt;br&gt;The product leaking from the big bag at the bottom of the pile caused the two bags above to crash on the ground, feeding the combustion process, developing flames and intensive smoke.&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile two other workers who had been alerted by the main alarm siren of the chlorine detectors reached the area shortly after the first worker and the shift supervisor sent them to the chlorine storage area.&amp;nbsp; They connected an extinguishing hose to the manifold of two pumps feeding from two 10m3 water tanks, which were used for operations under normal conditions. The tanks are located approximately 20 metres from the area affected by the fire. Shortly after the extinguishing hose had been connected and a small amount of water had been&amp;nbsp; pumped, the two pumps failed because the flames had reached the electric cable rack suspended at a height of 7 meters from the ground and passing parallel to the front side of the transit area (located above the passage of the drainage channel). &lt;br&gt;When the shift supervisor realised that the emergency response operation was impossible he alerted the security personnel of the plant and attempted to alert the fire brigade and the Emergency Response Centre of Catalunya (Centro de Emergencias de Catalunya - CECAT) but the telephone line was interrupted due to the fact that the telephone line also passes above the area in which the fire broke out.&lt;br&gt;One of the workers, looking for a telephone, tried to kick open the entrance door of the administration offices but broke the glass with his foot and cut his leg (the injury was considered as not serious).&lt;br&gt;At 20:43 hrs the emergency call number 112 received a phone call from a private citizen informing them that a fire had broken out in an industrial installation and the information was transmitted to the fire brigade.&lt;br&gt;When local police officers of the Catalonian autonomous police force (Mossos d'Esquadra) arrived&amp;nbsp; at the plant entrance and saw flames and smoke rising, they alerted the fire brigade.&lt;br&gt;At 20:51 hrs a fire brigade helicopter making a routine flight over the area reported that the size of the smoke cloud was large and that chlorine could be smelled.&lt;br&gt;The safety manager of the company arrived and at 20:58 hrs alerted the Emergency Response Centre of Catalunya (CECAT), responsible for releasing the Off-site Emergency Plan, informing them that the fire was significant and that it was releasing chlorine into the atmosphere.&lt;br&gt;At 20:50 hrs the fire brigade arrived on-site, the fire brigade was informed by the representatives of the operator about the fire, the release of chlorine and the need to employ self-contained breathing apparatus. The fire was spreading rapidly, affecting the installations passing through the roofing and the roofing panels of the transit area. &lt;br&gt;At 20:58 hrs, after extinguishing operations had been started, the chief officer of the fire brigade informed the Control Room that a chlorine cloud was forming.&lt;br&gt;At 21:05 hrs the officer requested activation of the off-site emergency response plan.&lt;br&gt;At 21:11 hrs the off-site emergency plan was activated, the municipalities located downwind and potentially affected by the cloud were informed about the occurrence and were requested to alert the population to immediately take shelter.&lt;br&gt;The first fire fighters reaching the site found one extinguishing system of the company out of order due to a missing pressure device.&lt;br&gt;At 21:49 hrs the fire was extinguished and the control room was notified.&lt;br&gt;At 22:15 hrs the on-site emergency&amp;nbsp;

It is assumed that the high temperature reached by the smoke when the fire was most intense caused the toxic cloud to pass over the nearby industries and dwellings. The complaints received later on came from urban areas further away in wind direction. The symptoms described concerned irritation of the eyes and the respiratory tract.
