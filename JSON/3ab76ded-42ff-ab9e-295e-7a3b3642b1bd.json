Wind conditions were slight and the vapours from the spilling liquid were not dispersed. In early 1986 it was noted that the flare gas recovery system was operating at reduced efficiency. Gas which should have been recovered was being routed instead to flare. Investigation revealed that a 750 mm valve was passing gas when in closed position. A decision was taken to have the valve removed to carry out repairs to it. It was appreciated that there would require to be careful planning to prevent the possibility of leave refinery units being inadvertently isolated from the flare system. One of the flares would have to be taken out of service and therefore the potential flaring demand of the refinery would need to be matched to the remaining two flares. At a number of meetings of operational and maintenance staff, an agreed flare alignment procedure was drawn up outlining flare system conditions necessary for removal of the valve. The earliest time to carry out the work was to be in early 1987 when 2 of the refinery units and flare No 1 were planned to be out of service for routine maintenance. The detailed work methods and safety requirements concerned with the actual removal of the valve were not considered at the meeting. No difficulties were foreseen and the works were organized and arranged by operations department technicians. Few days prior the accident, the valves to isolate live parts of the flare system from the section under maintenance were closed. Immediately prior to work commencing, the BP technician checked the status of isolation valves and he also identify conditions in the isolated section by opening a small valve on the liquid drain line at a distant flare knockout drum. Finding no indication of gas or liquid coming from the valve he assumed that the flare line was isolated, depressurised and free of liquid. Near the work station were located 2 water monitors to disperse residual gas if it should flow out when the valve was removed. Two refinery fire-fighters were present to operate the monitors and to oversee the use of the breathing apparatuses being used by the workers as protection against potentially toxic residual gases in the flare line. Also in the work area there was a crane to lift the heavy valve and a diesel engine compressor to supply air for the breathing apparatuses. Being everything in order, the BP technician issued the permit to the contractor and work commenced. Two fitters and a rigger prepared to remove a flange ring spacer to insert a blank spade in its taken by a crane. Suddenly it pulled upwards and torrents of liquid gushed out to cascade down over the scaffold. Gases from the spilled liquid spread over the ground igniting on the engine of the air spread to cover the pool of liquid and envelop the scaffold and the men in a raging inferno.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;

The liquid was ignited by a nearby air compressor engine (used to supply air for the breathing apparatuses of the maintenance crew) and a pool fire occurred. The scaffold platform and the people on it were enveloped in flames.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CAUSES:&lt;br&gt;It soon became apparent that in the flare pipework scale had formed over the years. This scale had flaked off from internal surfaces to accumulate at the bottom of the flare pipelines where it turned into a thick viscous-sludge in the presence of vented and condensed hydrocarbon liquids. The sludge had found its way into the guides of flare line wedge gate valves which where thus prevented from closing fully. Sludge had also passed down liquid drain lines at the knock-out drums to cause them to block. &lt;br&gt;Therefore the normal drainage built into the flare system no longer operated and as a result substantial quantities of liquid accumulated. The flare line isolation valves had no means of indicating their fully closed position. It was assumed that exerting considerable force on the handles of valves was sufficient indication. Many of the suppose closed valves were found to be jammed and were still allowing free passages of gas. The pipe to the valve used to test line conditions was also blocked with sludge. Therefore presence of liquids and gases in the line was not identified when the valve was open. Furthermore, the technician judged that residual flammable gases in the flare pipe presented no significant fire hazard. Therefore the system was not purged with inert nitrogen nor steam. In addition, the flare drainage was not verified as being clear of blockages nor the valves as being clear obstruction by the use of injected steam. &lt;br&gt;Work methods have not been planned to take sufficient account of the risk of residual liquid being present in the flare.&lt;br&gt;"],"Other":[""]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["bb261502-c1cb-c500-114f-f5c3fda67db9"],"Consequence_Description":["EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:&lt;br&gt;When the liquid was ignited, the scaffold platform and the people on it were engulfed in flames.
