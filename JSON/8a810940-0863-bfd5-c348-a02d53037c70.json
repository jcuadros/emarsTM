In 3-4 minutes the squad-leader informed the local fire-station and also the county emergency directorate. The competent managers of the company were ordered in. The plant firemen rescued the casualty (5:17), localized the fire, and then extinguished. The local firemen arrived at site (5:30) helped in post-accident activity. The seriously injured worker was brought to central medical ambulance and from there to county hospital. Meanwhile the informed leaders of authorities arrived. The fire-fighting was finished by 6:20. The reconstruction of the installation was finished by 22. 09. 2003.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seveso II duties - remarks: &lt;/strong&gt;By the time of accident the safety analysis of the plant was not prepared. The amended government decree of 2/2001 stated 1st April 2003 as deadline for sending in the safety analyses, thus the plant could fulfill the SEVESO II obligations and undertakings only in part.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discussion about the response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 5:15 on 3rd December 2002 fire-alarm came from the plant, which was confirmed also by phone. The firemen went to site immediately with all of the fire-extinguishing equipments. 4 person and the safety officer on duty went to the site.&lt;br&gt;Fire was seen in room for weighing dangerous material.&lt;br&gt;Exploring the sit they observed one person in fire. The reinforced glass wall beside the door has been broken by the firemen. The person in fire stepped out.&lt;br&gt;The officer on duty and the workers helped the casualty to get into the car and in transport. At 5:20 the staff was ordered to assemble one fire-extinguisher powder-gusher and extinguish the fire of unknown material, which went out by using the powder-gusher. Meanwhile the firemen noticed that there is fire around the toluene-tank.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They experienced that the equipment were in fire, heavy, black smoke coming through the door. The staff was ordered to replace the powder-gusher. While the replace of powder-gusher was not ready they started to extinguish the fire with 50 kg dry chemical extinguisher placed near to the room. The fire went out, but we saw leak on top of the equipment and on two places behind o fit, which reinflamed in short time. By that time the replacement of powder-gusher was done and we shot the powder. After this the fire went out, and then 2-3 times reinflamed and liquid material was leaking further to the top of the equipment and behind the equipment. Because of this in about one minute after extinguishing the fire there was a larger reinflame of fire, but it was also extinguished with powder-gusher, but because of these inflammations the electrical lines under the ceiling on cable-ladder were in flame and the fire spread in direction of control room. By this time I ordered to replace the powder-gusher to the other entrance and we tried to get a reinflaming fire under. By this time arrived the department leader. After consulting with him beside applying the powder-gusher, they ordered to assemble a water-gusher, because they got by this time the putting out declaration of electrical office on duty. After this the electrical cable and minor reinflames were extinguished by water-gusher. The gusher had to be replaced to direction of control room, because the fire spread on cable to that direction. Meanwhile the fire-protection leader arrived, who ordered a worker and/or a fireman to install a generator-lighting to the entrance near to control room. Further this door was used for extinguishing the cable fire. Two firemen started to explore the upper floor, with help of firemen, who arrived by that time. Because of high temperature and heavy smoke the orientation was not easy, but they did not experienced fire in the upper floor, only in the right lower part of the computer room. For extinguishing of this fire a new gusher was assembled, in which the firemen helped. The fire went out in minutes, later the focus went to cooling the equipment, and/or in upper floor, furthermore in ground floor the drying external door and the transit door in front of the fire were opened.&lt;br&gt;Later we got request to cool the centrifugal machine and the equipment above, which was requested by the division leader.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"],"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["6799492a-0079-4d05-aad1-8f4dce857337"],"LastUser":{"UserId":["6799492a-0079-4d05-aad1-8f4dce857337"],"Name":["Enrico"],"Surname":["GUAGNINI"],"IsVisibleSensibleData":[false]},"LastDate":["2019-04-10T08:52:21.12"],"ParentCompany":{},"Region":{},"Province":{},"City":{},"PostCode":{},"Concurrency":[0]},"LockedUserId":{},"LockedDate":{},"IsLocked":[false],"IsLockedByMe":[false],"LockedUser":{}},"AccidentProfile_Tab":{"ReportingAuthority":{},"ContactPerson":{},"Reasons":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Substances involved: greater than 5% of quantity in Column 3 of Annex I"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Injury to persons: &gt;= 1 fatalities, &gt;= 6 hospitalizing injuries etc."},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Immediate damage to the environment (according to Annex VI)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Damage to property: on-site &gt;2M &amp;euro;, off-site &gt; 0.5M &amp;euro;"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"Cross-border damage: transboundary accidents"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"Interesting for lessons learned."}],"AffectedCountries":{}},"AccidentDescription_Tab":{"AccidentDescription":{"DominoEffects":[false],"NatechEvents":[false],"TransboundaryEffects":[false],"Contractors":[false],"accTypeRelease":[0],"accTypeFire":[0],"accTypeExplosion":[0],"accTypeTransport":[0],"accTypeOther":{},"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["6799492a-0079-4d05-aad1-8f4dce857337"],"LastDate":["2019-04-10T08:52:21.12"],"Concurrency":[0],"Translation":{"VersionId":["2f51e993-5e5d-4f9e-a96a-8467846f2db0"],"LanguageId":["EN"],"AccidentDescription":["&lt;p&gt;Serious industrial accident happened, 1 casualty died two days after transported to hospital&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The casualty died later worked together with colleagues on 2nd December 2002 in the night shift.
