The explosion occurred while two workers were concluding (finishing) the loading (filling, charging) with nitrocellulose scales of a mixer (dissolver) of 4 m3 containing ethyl acetate. The nitrocellulose was stored in barrels (kegs) and was poured in the hopper of a worm feeder equipped with a shielded (explosion protected) motor. Small fires developed following the ignition of flammable materials (rags, ink tanks, resins, pigments) present in the hall (hangar). The few barrels (kegs) near the mixer which had still to be charged  did not catch fire. The two operators (workers) were injured, but not as seriously as a worker a few metres from the hall (hangar) who was carrying out transport operations of barrels (kegs) with a lift truck (3rd degree burns), he has been hit by the flash. Another worker who was working in a laboratory adjacent to the hall (hangar) when the explosion occurred was seriously injured by a separating wall which fell down due to the pressure wave.\n&lt;br&gt;The causes of the accident have not yet been identified, the starting point has also not been determined. Nevertheless it is plausible to assume that the explosion occurred externally of the mixer, due to the fact that the lid of the mixer stayed in its place (original position). The explosion should have had the characteristics of a deflagration. The loading (filling, charging) with nitrocellulose is performed by inserting feed-line (supply line) through a hatch located on the mixer lid. Eye witnesses have stated that they have seen a flash (fire) develop more or less at the same time of (concurrently to) the blast (explosion). The flash (fire) has fully hit the worker on the lift truck, severely burning him. The equipment (appliances) inside the hall (building) do not show evident damages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The explosion occurred when the loading (charging) operation with nitrocellulose&amp;nbsp; was almost terminated (finished).&lt;br&gt;The access to the hall is blocked due to the demolition (collapse) of the structure. As a consequence it has been impossible at the moment to find any element for identifying the causes and the ignition source.&lt;br&gt;The two operators have declared to have followed the standard procedures. &lt;br&gt;Regular training courses are held for the personnel.&lt;br&gt;The witnesses present have moreover declared to have smelled the presence of ethyl acetate vapours, which are recognisable through the intense smell.&lt;br&gt;More or less at the same time as the explosion a violent flash (fire) developed which has hit plainly one operator which was driving a lift truck a few metres outside the hall (hangar).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;

The mixer in question did not show\nserious damages, due to the fact that the explosion occurred most\nprobably above the mixer. The motor of the feeder was thrown\n(projected) at a distance of 2.5 m (metres) from the mixer, whereas the\nscrew (worm) of the feeder although being damaged, stayed in its place,\nand turned over laterally (on a side) due to the pressure wave. Many\nwindows broke in the buildings of the establishment up to 200 m from\nthe explosion point. There have been no effects off-site (outside of)\nthe establishment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People - Remarks: &lt;br&gt;13 persons were injured of\nwhich 5 not seriously which were dismissed from hospital the next day,\n6 of the other 8 received a prognosis between 30 and 60 days, the other\ntwo a reserved prognosis. One of the seriously injured received 3rd\n(third) degree burns on 70% of the body whereas the other one suffered\nfrom a head injury, multiple fractures and a liver injury.\nThere were 20 persons present in the hall when the accident occurred.\nIt has not been considered necessary to include in the population at\nrisk the other workers present in the establishment (approx. 250\nothers), although they may have been exposed to the risk of injury from\nthe projection of fragments (glass in particular).\nThere has been no damage to the personnel of the emergency relief teams\nnor to persons outside the establishment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ecological harm - Remarks: &lt;br&gt;The fire extinguishing water was collected in the used water recovery tanks of the establishment&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Material loss - Remarks: &lt;br&gt;Damage to equipment has still to be evaluated. Relevant damages to the structures of hall No. 13 and to a lot of windows (glazing) of the buildings in the establishment. The economic damages have therefore still to be quantified.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Disruption of community life: &lt;br&gt;There has been no interruption of services outside the establishment.
