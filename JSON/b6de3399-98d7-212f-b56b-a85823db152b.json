A large number of press organisations immediately sent reporting teams to the site; they arrived before any overview of the situation could be obtained and even before any real operational command post could be set up. This almost instantaneous media coverage of the event created a strong pressure of information demand on all those involved in the response operations, even before the establishment of structures for co-ordination and for the collection of reliable information on the event and its consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As an accident occurs, the emergency services must prioritise the following two main aspects of crisis management:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&amp;nbsp; The mobilisation and the up-grading of the system for immediate emergency response&lt;br&gt;*&amp;nbsp; The activation of the co-ordination and command structure, in order to facilitate:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - The drawing up of a preliminary overview of the situation and the correct assessment of the event;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - The activation of a structured system for gathering and recovering verified information;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - Control of the spreading of the warning after the event.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last point can be achieved only by the activation of an operational command post on the site and of a crisis management team in an operational command room of the prefecture. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"EmergencyResponce_Descr":["The emergency services react quickly. A large plume of black smoke develops and partially touches the nearby urbanised zone. Since the meteorological situation was not favourable for the rising and the dispersion of the plume, the emergency services ask the population to remain inside the buildings. The event is abundantly covered by the media because of the broadcasting of the directions for confinement by the local radios. Three schools located in the direction of the plume are evacuated. The fire is under control after 2h 30 min. The confinement measures are suspended around 13:30, since the fire has been extinguished. The emergency services keep monitoring the situation during the whole of the following day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the fire was extinguished, a number of measures were taken to ensure a follow-up:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * Protective Measures:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - Inspection of all installations and&amp;nbsp; assessment of the operational conditions of the site (administrative and regulatory situation),&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - Prefect's decree prohibiting the resumption of activities and prescribing clean-up - waste storage -&amp;nbsp; and waste removal - measures to be carried out,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * Health-related measures:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - Consultation of 360 doctors on the health-related consequences of exposure to the smoke,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * Environmental measures:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - A monitoring campaign of the ground and of vegetation in the area affected by the accident,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - Monitoring analysis of the extinguishing water originating from the fire fighting, of the sewage water and of the water in the sewage treatment plant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The following results were obtained:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * With respect to health and the environment, the impact was minor.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * At the time of the accident, the company was operating the plant in a way that anticipated the authorisations that had been applied for.
