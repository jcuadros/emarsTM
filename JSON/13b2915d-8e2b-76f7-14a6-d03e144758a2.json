All the processes were carried out in one common production building. The main process area included 12 process reactors ranging in size from 1,000 to 8,000 litres. These reactors were usually assigned to a particular synthesis but could be used for other processes if the chemicals used were compatible with them. Reactors 2 and 6 were dedicated to hydrogenation reactions. The reactor manlids were approached from the first floor level while the underside of the reactors were approached from the ground floor level. A pilot plant, two quality control laboratories, one research laboratory, two mill rooms and an office led on to the first floor process area. Operator's locker rooms and services were located on the mezzanine floor below the quality control laboratories. Reactor 6 which was involved in the accident was used to carry out the hydrogenation of a pharmaceutical intermediate, carried out by bubbling hydrogen into a well stirred mixture of the intermediate in acetone, the solvent, with a palladium catalyst at 35oC. The hydrogen was fed into the reactor through a 1cm pipe from a cylinder bank stored at ground floor level.The operation of the plant was organized in two shifts.

A quality control analysis of this material showed that the reaction was progressing satisfactorily before the incident. Examinations have shown that combustion should be supported inside the reactor as nitrous oxide was generated in the process. An electrostatic discharge could have caused the first explosion but this was considered unlikely on investigation. The most probable cause of the incident was a defective agitator. The maintenance record on the agitator showed that it malfunctioned on numerous occasions  but the maintenance was not sufficient. It was felt that the agitator possibly malfunctioned again allowing a hydrogen leak. As the reactor was located in a general process area with plants operating nearby, the released hydrogen could easily have found an ignition source as some of the electrical plants operating nearby were not suitable for use with hydrogen. The investigation showed that the reactor's pressure relief line did not operate as the bursting disc was found to be intact.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"Other":[""]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["6b794fd5-3485-98e0-a9a5-4f4d0169ef4e"],"Consequence_Description":["MATERIAL LOSS:&lt;br&gt;The extent of the damage caused by the explosion and the following fires was as follows: the reactor was badly distorted; the valve on the underside of Reactor 6 was also distorted and leaked; the sightglass in the manlid was shattered; the agitator was blown from its seating and deposited a few metres away; the glass fittings on Reactors 5 and 7 were shattered; electric cable insulation was charred and paintwork on the walls, ceilings and nearby millroom doors was scorched as far as 15 metres away; the glass in the windows on the first floor was shattered and the window frames distorted next to Reactors 5 and 7; windows up to 30 metres were blown out.
