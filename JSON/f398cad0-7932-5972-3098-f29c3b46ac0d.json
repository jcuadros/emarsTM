After completing the works at 8:00 in the morning of 12\nOctober 2006 the work was begun on starting up the KR-601/2 furnace. The\nburners were ignited in the KR‑601/2 furnace, the temperature was raised and\nthe furnace heating spirals were filled with fuel oil, which began feeding into\nthe K-601 column at 9:28 of the same day. Prior to connecting KR‑601/2 to the\nsystem, the raw material was fed into the K-601 column by heating it in the KR-601/1\nreserve furnace. The technological parameters of the KR-601/1 furnace and K‑601\ncolumn were within the allowed limits. The KR-601/2 furnace was connected to the system by\ngradually raising the temperature of the raw material supplied to the column.\nAccording to the technical regulation of the vacuum fuel oil rectification and tar\nvisbreaking section 001 of the combined technological device KT-1/1 for deep\nprocessing of fuel oil, the temperature of the supplied raw material needs to\nbe raised by 30 to 35°C per hour. It is apparent from the analysis of the diagrams\nof technological parameters that from 12:55 to 14:24 the temperature of the raw\nmaterial being supplied was rising by 38 to 45°C per hour, meaning that the\nlimits specified in the technical regulation were being exceeded. Certain other divergences from the technological regime can\nbe seen from the diagrams of the parameters of the technological regime: - at 9:32 and at 9:48 the vacuum pressure in the column\ndecreased to 104.435 mm Hg st. and 67.018 mm Hg st. respectively (usually the vacuum\npressure in the column is about 20 mm Hg st.); - from 13:37 the level of tar started decreasing sharply at\nthe bottom of the K‑601 column, and at 14:24 the measuring devices could not\nregister it at all. According to the technical regulation, the level of tar at\nthe bottom of the column must remain within the limits of 40 to 90%; - from 14:00 to 14:23 the pressure of the cleavage gas in\nseparators SP-603/1 and SP-603/2 started increasing sharply (from 0.53 bar. to\n-0.335 bar.); - from 10:55 to 12:25 the total amount of raw material being\nfed into the K-601 column was about 544 m3/h. At 13:55 the amount of the raw\nmaterial being supplied decreased to 447 m3/h. The debit was increased,\nand at 14:25 the amount of the raw material being fed into the column was 520\nm3/h. At 14:30 the supply of the raw material into the column stopped\ncompletely . - At 14:24 there was a complete absence of vacuum pressure\nin the K-601 column; - At 14:30 the S-608 pump stopped pumping and was operating\nan empty cycle. The Communication Point of the Operative Management Section\nof the Fire Rescue Service of omissis received the fire alarm from\nthe K-601 column at 14:32 after the fire safety alarm was set in bases Nos 6\nand 7 of section 001. The firefighters on duty in team 1 of the omissis Fire Safety Service were the first to begin extinguishing the fire in section\n001, using fire rescue truck PA-40(131)137. The remaining firefighters in team 1\nand team 2 were immediately sent to site of the fire. When the first of those\nteams arrived at the site at 14:36 the column and an area covering 200 sq.m. at\nthe bottom of the column were alight. When the column collapsed at 14:54 the\nfire spread across an area of 800 sq. m."],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;

In addition to the technological processes referred\nabove, the utilization of gas heat and heat of technological flows resulting\nfrom the process of regeneration of catalytic cracking and operation of tubular\nfurnaces is foreseen in the technological device. The KT-1/1 combined\ntechnological device was put into operation in 1989. The KT-1/1 combined technological device for deep processing\nof fuel oil consists of the following administrative devices: - device No1 – technological devices for vacuum\nrectification of fuel oil and tar visbreaking (001 section); - device No2 – technological device for hydro-purification\nof vacuum distillate with a block of hydrocarbon and hydrogen gas purification\nmonoethanolamine solution (section 100) and a technological device for\nMTBE or ETBE production; - device No3 – technological device for catalytic cracking,\nrectification, absorption and gas fractioning with a block for purification of\nsulphur compounds from technological condensate (section 200/300); - device No4 – technological device for heat utilization and\nheating systems (section 400). The following oil products are derived from the KT-1/1\ncombined technological complex: 1. stable catalytically cracked gasoline – vehicle petrol\ncomponent; 2. propane-propene and buthane-buthene fraction – raw\nmaterial derived from alkylation, MTBE (ETBE) production, oligomerisation and petrochemical\nprocesses or components of liquefied trade oil gas; 3. methyl tretbuthyl ether (MTBE) or ethyl tretbuthyl ether\nor a combination of ethers – multi-octane petrol component; 4. diesel distillates – vacuum distillate hydro-purifying\ndiesel distillate (fraction 160‑370 oC), catalytic cracking light\ndiesel distillate (fr. 160-300 oC) and heavy diesel distillate (fr. 300-500\noC), visbreaking light diesel distillate (fr. 160-390 oC) and heavy diesel\ndistillate (fr. 260-380 oC), diesel distillate from vacuum rectification (fr. up\nto 360 oC), directed for further processing; 5. fraction 310-420 oC and fraction exceeding 420 oC – components\nof heating fuel oil; 6. stabile secondary petrol – vacuum distillate\nhydro-purification and visbreaking petrol distillate, directed for further\nprocessing (hydrogenation and catalytic reforming); 7. hydrocarbon gas used in the form of gas fuel for\ntechnological purposes; 8. hydrogen sulphide in monoethanolamine solution; 9. visbreaking fraction exceeding 350 oC - heating fuel oil\ncomponent. Object of the accident – the fuel oil vacuum rectification K-601\ncolumn in the 001 section of the KT-1/1 combined technological device for deep\nprocessing of fuel oil was mounted in September 1988. The column was put into\noperation in April 1989. The height of the column is 37 meters and the diameter\nis 5.5-8.8-5.5 meters. Its general purpose is to increase the output of the\nlight oil products. Primary (atmospheric) fuel oil, the raw material of the vacuum\nrectification process of fuel oil, is supplied to furnaces KR-601/1,2 by\nS-601/1,2,R pumps via feedwater heaters by two flows. The partially evaporated\nfuel oil that is heated in furnaces then enters into K-601 vacuum column by two\ntransfer pipelines. Four load layers are mounted in the K‑601 column. A\nchute-type humidifier is mounted over the third load layer and sprayer\nhumidifiers are installed over other load layers. Tare, which is the product resulting from the K-601 column,\nis extracted from the device by S-608/1,2 and S-613/1,r pumps for further\nprocessing. The cleavage gas from the top of the column is cooled and enters\ninto separators SP-603/1,2, and subsequently to the fuel gas line. The diesel\nfraction is retracted from the upper part of the column and the vacuum\ndistillate – from the middle part. Vacuum in the K-601 column is formed by\nspecial vacuum formers (ejectors), by using diesel as a working reagent. &lt;span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: 'Tahoma','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman';

These technical modifications\nare not shown in the drawings of the technical passport of the K-601 column. It\nwas found during the investigation that the design solution to replace the coupling\njunction with a connection by welding was adopted and approved in 1987. On the\nbasis of the same solution, the steal containing 5% Cr and 0.5% Mo (steal type\naccording to GOST 5520-79), as foreseen in the initial project for the\nproduction from the 426 x 10 pipe of the elements of the technological pipeline\nNo 619/1 connected to the junction pipe of the K‑601 column, was replaced\nby carbonic construction steal 22K, according to GOST 5520-79. According to the\nglobally recognised methods against corrosion, if the technological product\nsulphur content exceeds 0.5% and the product temperature exceeds 260 0C, corrosion\nand heat-proof metal must be used (as was foreseen in the initial project). As\nthe technological product sulphur content of the K-601 column and the product\ntemperature highly exceeds the values referred above (2.6% and 625 0C\naccordingly), it can be stated that the replacement of the type of steal was an\ninadequate solution that resulted in the corrosion of the pipeline\nNo 619/1. This is confirmed by tests carried out during the investigation,\naccording to which, the metal of the wall of the separated pipe in the pipeline\nNo 619/1, between the parts of the vacuum column and the separation valve,\nis affected by inter‑crystal corrosion and bottom layer erosion (corrosion).\nThe investigated parts of the technological pipeline No 619/1 were\naffected by erosion (corrosion) at the time of operation and up to the moment\nof fire. It is likely that the thinning of different walls of the pipe was\npredicated by erosion (corrosion) before the fire. The thickness of the wall in\nsome places was only 0.15 mm. It was found during the investigation that, at the moment when\nthe fire was detected and during the extinguishing of the initial fire, it was the\nbottom part of the K-601 column, located in the intermediary area of the\npedestal of the K-601 column and between feedwater heaters of the column and\nsection 001 of the KT 1/1 technological device that was on fire. According to the opinion of the investigating commission,\nthe most likely reason for the fire in the section 001 of the KT 1/1 combined\ntechnological device for deep processing of fuel oil is the ignition of the\ntechnological product (tar), previously heated to the self‑incineration\ntemperature, after this product burst out through the crack (or cracks) in the\npart affected by corrosion of the technological pipeline No 619/1 between the\njunction pipe of the K-601 column and the separating valve. Such cracks may\nhave resulted from the thinning of the wall in the part of the said pipeline to\nthe level that it was not able to resist the pressure load. It results from the analysis of the technical regulation of\nthe vacuum fuel oil rectification and tar visbreaking 001 section of the\ncombined technological device KT-1/1 for deep processing of fuel oil, that the\nactions of the technological staff faced with changes in technological\nparameters (tar level at the bottom of the K-601 column (the cube) or vacuum\nlevel inside the column K-601) and their technological management are not\nstrictly regulated and the technological staff operating the device acts on the\nbasis of instructions from their directors or based on their own personal\nexperience. At the time of the accident the staff operating the device notices\nany change in technological parameters (decrease of the tar level at the bottom\nof the column and sudden decrease of vacuum in the column itself) attempted to\nrestore the parameters, by regulating the column load and the tar debit from\nthe bottom of the column, but at that time the product was already coming\nthrough the possible place of dehermetisation in the part of the technological\npipeline No 619/1 between the K-601 column junction pipe and the\nseparating valve. It has almost been an hour (from 13:37 to 14:30) that no one\nof the operating personnel passed through the K-601 column and inspected it or\nthe related equipment, in order to identify the reasons for the decreased tar\nlevel in the cube of the K-601 column. On 15 October 2004 the management plans approved by the\nchairperson of the board of omissis provided for the reduction of\noperating costs, by extending the intervals between general repairs by at least\n4 years and more, and, at the same time, for the improvement of the long-term\nreliability of devices. According to the commission, this decision fails to\nimprove the long-term reliability of devices, as the repairs of separate\ndevices, without stopping the production for general repairs, cannot allow the\nfull taking into account of the wear and tear of the devices and their\ncondition. The last general repairs at omissis were carried out in\n2003, and the repairs planned for 2006 were postponed. The manufacturer set a service period of 11 years for the\nK-601 vacuum column (technical passport of the device, page 129, Table 2\n“Technical characteristics”). The inner condition of the K-601 column was\ninspected on 26 September 1997 together with hydraulic tests. Based on the\ninspection and test results, also the investigations performed and conclusions\npresented by the joint stock omissis, omissis decided\nto extend the period of operation of the column (the fact recorded in the\ntechnical passport of the K-601 column). The last inspection of the inner and outer condition of the\nK-601 column was performed on 9 January 2006 (the fact recorded in the\ntechnical passport of the K-601 column). According to the requirements of the\nInstructions No BM-2 for using pressure vessels, the next date for the\ninner and outer inspection of the column was set to 9 January 2010, i.e. the\nplanned frequency of the inspections was 4 years. Acting on the basis of the Instruction for the use of\npressure pipelines No BM-4, approved Order No 83 of the deputy\ndirector for production technology and capital integration of omissis\nof 23 April 2004, the pipeline maintenance engineer of the Diagnostic Facility\nperforms the technical inspections of the pressure pipeline No619/1 (from the K-601\ncolumn to the pumps S-608, S-613/1, S-613/2). The last inspection of the operating\npipeline No 619/1 (hereinafter referred to as IOP) and the full\nverification of its technical condition (hereinafter referred to as VTC) was\nperformed on 15 December 2004. The inspection found some minor shortcomings,\nhowever, it concluded that the repairs of the pipeline were not necessary, and\nthe next inspection dates were set accordingly at 15 December 2008 for IOP and\n15 December 2010 for VTC (the fact recorded in the technical passport of the\nK-601 column)."],"Other":[""]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","CauseType":{"Type_ID":4,"Category":"all","Description":"unclear"},"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["467c544b-4c7b-c6c9-4021-da9621265141"],"Consequence_Description":["&lt;font face=\"tahoma\" size=\"2\"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;The samples of ambient air in omissis, omissis and omissis\nvillages were taken and their residents were inquired.
