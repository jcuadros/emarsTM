This water, which contains traces of hydrocarbons, is normally sent to the treatment plant to have the hydrocarbon concentration reduced to the level at which it is permitted to discharge to waste water.&lt;br&gt;According to the company management, the hydrocarbons normally lie at the top of the tank, with a maximum depth of about 10 cm. - which corresponds to a quantity of c. 20 m3. At the time of the accident, there was a depth of 3.4 m. of hydrocarbons, corresponding to a volume of 680 m3. &lt;br&gt;For reasons which the company are still investigating, some hydrocarbon had been released from the tank, presumably from the vent on the floating roof. Apparently some of this material was then carried to the base of the tank by the internal drainage pipes. The tank does not have a retention cuvette.&lt;br&gt;The vaporisation of the hydrocarbons led to the formation of some 60m. of vapour cloud, which extended to the nearby Provincial road Arquata Scrivia - Vignole B.&lt;br&gt;According to witnesses, the cloud was ignited by the passage of two lorries. There was heard a first explosion, followed some seconds later by two more.
