Wind direction variable between 60°-90°. The atmospheric stability was assessed as Pasquill category \"D\".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:&lt;br&gt;At 15:30 the crankcase of an URACA horizontal action 3 throw pump, used to boost liquid ammonia pressure from 300 psi to 3,400 psi, was punctured by fragments of the failed pump-ram crankshaft. The two operators investigating the previously reported noises from the pump were engulfed in ammonia and immediately overcome by fumes. Once the pump crackcase was broken, nothing could be done to prevent the release of the contents of the surge drum (10 tonnes were released in the first three minutes). The supply of ammonia from the ring main could only be stopped by switching off the supply pump locally. No one were able to do this as the two gas-tight suits available were preferentially used for search and rescue operations, and thus release of ammonia continued.&amp;nbsp; Ammonia fumes quickly began to enter the plant control room and the operators hardly had the time to sound the alarms and start the plant shut-down before they had to leave the building using 10 minutes escape breathing apparatus sets. During the search and rescue operation the fire authorities did not use the gas-tight suits and fumes entered the gaps around the face piece and caused injuries to 5 men. The ammonia cloud generated by the initial release drifted off-site and remained at a relatively low level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The supply of ammonia from the ring main could only be stopped by switching off the supply pump locally. No one were able to do this as the two gas-tight suits available were preferentially used for search and rescue operations, and thus release of ammonia continued. Ammonia fumes quickly began to enter the plant control room and the operators hardly had the time to sound the alarms and start shutting down the plant before they had to leave the building using 10-minutes escape breathing set. The on-site emergency plan was activated within minutes of the alarm being sounded; a roll call quickly established that only two men were missing. The two gas-tight suits were used to search and rescue rather than to isolate the ammonia ring supply. The isolation of the main ring was achieved 40 minutes after the start of the release: in this period of time 28 tonnes of ammonia (in addition to the 10 tonnes initially released) escaped to the atmosphere.&lt;br&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;

The initial release of 10 tonnes in the first 3 minutes (the contents of the surge drum) was followed by 28 tonnes in the subsequent 40 minutes until the ammonia ring main was isolated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CAUSES:&lt;br&gt;The crankshaft of the Uraca pump failed catastrophically smashing itself through the crankcase. Failure of the crankshaft was due to to the propagation of a fatigue crack through the web separating the first and second crank pins. Metallurgical investigations found no initiating defect leading to crack propagation. It is thought that the failure was due to some overload of the web/crank pin radius at some unknown time. No inspections were foreseen for this component.&amp;nbsp; The pump design was not adequate (code 5308).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"Other":[""]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["2cecab8b-8340-7480-5016-68adc89d2583"],"Consequence_Description":["EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:&lt;br&gt;3,000 on-site people were exposed. 2 operators were immediately killed by the toxic release (they were investigating previously reported noises from the pump when the leak happened and they were surrounded by fumes). 5 members of the fire brigades were injured by ammonia because they did not use gas-tight suits and fumes entered the gaps around the face pieces of the suits.&lt;br&gt;About 50,000 off-site people were exposed to the fumes (up to 7 km away) but nobody was seriously affected.
