The shift personnel present onsite and in particular the shift foreman who was staying on the main access ramp to the atmospheric distillation plants, testified that he saw the jet-fire ignite from the top and propagate down (from approx 18m above ground down to approx 14m in the area comprised between the exchangers E1718 A/B/C and the reactor R1702). Immediately the shift foreman activated the onsite emergency plan and informed the gate guard in order to alert the fire brigade. At 21:40 the fire brigade was alerted. The jet fire affected the quench-line with the 3\" hydrogen pipe, which ruptured after 6 min. exposure with the consequent ignition of the hydrogen. The fire took a cylindrical form from the bottom to the top starting at 14 m height affecting above located plant parts, comprising under other the pre-heater of the diathermic oil. Approx 30 minutes after the fire ignited a 8\" fuel pipe of the diathermic oil system ruptured and subsequent ignition of the product. The fire was kept under control and evolved without noticeable changes until consumption of the fuel once the pipes were shut off according to the emergency response plan which had been activated. &lt;br&gt;The fire was extinguished at 1:20 h on 02/09/2005 (3 hours and 40 minutes after the fire initiated) and the state of emergency was called off by the fire brigade at 1:45 h.&lt;br&gt;No damages to persons has been reported consequent to the accident.&lt;br&gt;According to damage evaluations performed, there has not been any environmental damage, this evaluation has been confirmed also by an environmental indicators assessment performed by ARPA of Genoa.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;

Once the water contained is eliminated, the charge is pre-heated and then transferred to the reaction section working at 60 bars of pressure.&lt;br&gt;Before the charge enters the reactor the charge is mixed with the hot recycled hydrogen and then heated up to optimal temperature for the catalytic reaction (on average 360Â°) through a closed circuit of heating oil. An appropriate catalyst inside the reactor facilitates the desulphuration reactions inside the reactor. (hydrogenation of sulphur in H2S).&lt;br&gt;The reactor effluents , constituted by desulphurised fuel oil and a gas mixture, is cooled down and sent to a liquid-gas separator. The gas constituted principally of hydrogen is washed and purified from the hydrogen sulphide before being recycled, while the desulphurised heavy fuel oil feeds a pre-strippingcolumn (T-1707), the head flow of this column is then sent to the stripping column of the light fuel-oil section (T-1701).&lt;br&gt;The pre-stripped heavy fuel fraction (bottom T-1707) is heated and sent to the main

Also the video confirms Ã¹ the pipe rupture 30 min after fire begin.&lt;br&gt;For the same reason a release from the hydrogen pipes it is not considered likely, the records demonstrate that the hydrogen pipe failed 7 min after fire begin.&lt;br&gt;Concerning the flange joints of exchangers E-1718, E-1719 experts requested the dismounting of the exchanger flanged joints, the joint gaskets resulted to be not damaged.&lt;br&gt;For this reason the company considers the failure of a pipe from the pressure measurement gauges of reactor R-1702 as the most likely accident triggering factor, this assumption is supported by the following facts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1: this part is located in the area corresponding to the epicentre of the fire&lt;br&gt;2: the area corresponds to the area visually identified by the witnesses&lt;br&gt;3 the product release (hydrogen an fuel oil) from one of this pipes can cause a 6 m long jet flame as occurred.&lt;br&gt;4. the product supposedly released would have had a high enough temperature and pressure to self-self-ignite or ignite against a hot spot of the plant like the hot oil circuit.&lt;br&gt;5: the damages recorded are caused by overheating (flame exposition) and were not caused by overpressure or explosion&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; the pressure measurement records confirm significant pressure changes at the beginning of the event.&lt;br&gt;The company does not have any element allowing to identify the failure cause of that
