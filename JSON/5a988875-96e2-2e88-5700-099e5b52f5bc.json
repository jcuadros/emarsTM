For the rupture of a gasoline pipe the extension of the damage area had been estimated in maximally 30m, corresponding to a heat irradiation of 3kw/m2 (reversible damage area), involving either road ex SS114 and the railway depending from the source location. &lt;br&gt;Therefore the effects of the heat irradiation foreseen in the accident scenario of the Safety Report are compatible with the effects of the accident which occurred really.&lt;br&gt;The management faults occurred during the event, i.e. the faulty application of the emergency response procedures foreseen in the onsite emergency response plan, points out the need to improve the training of the personnel, with a particular focus on emergency management.&lt;br&gt;Following the event the Regional Technical Committee has delivered the technical feasibility authorisation concerning the reconstruction of the pipe bundle and the repair of the subway (resolution n° 87&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 12/12/06).

This circumstance has not allowed, according to the technical consultancy report, to verify the compliance with the technical norms on visual tests, inspections and maintenance of the piping system concerned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Concerning the cause of the fire, the company made the supposition that, , the contact between the vapours formed from the spilled hydrocarbons with hot spots of high pressure steam pipes, reaching up to 280° steam temperature, in correspondence of the subway, may have contributed to the expansion of a vapour cloud; the vapour cloud ignited on an ignition source downhill from the subway were the first fire was detected.&lt;br&gt;Concerning the successive BLEVEs, which caused major damage to the persons involved in the emergency response operations, these are related directly to the permanent heat irradiation of the fire (which lasted approx. 48 hrs), which overheated other pipelines containing hydrocarbons also in gas form in the pipe string. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Concerning the direct involvement of the company, the same company states that the event may have had less serious consequences if the onsite fire brigade would have been alerted immediately at leak detection and not three hours later, as effectively happened.&lt;br&gt;This assumption is confirmed by the technical consultancy report, which affirms that if the onsite fire brigade would have been alerted more rapidly the damages caused by the fire could have been contained.&lt;br&gt;Concerning this aspect it has to be said that the Attorney General's Office is still investigating on the matter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Human error indicated relates to the faulty application of the Emergency procedures foreseen in the onsite Emergency Plan.&lt;br&gt;The fault during the Repair operation (dismantling of the pipe insulation layer) relates to the failure to adopt appropriate safety measures during the operation.&lt;br&gt;The design fault relates to the inadequate

The area has been cleaned by excavating the ground until 30 cm depth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As already mentioned in the short report:&lt;br&gt;The company has monitored the water shed on request of the Regional&amp;nbsp; competent Authority by employing the existing piezometers nearest to the area affected, and did not detect any significant variations of the pollution levels with respect to the values determined before the accident.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emission of combustion products in the atmosphere :&lt;br&gt;- ARPA - Sicilia (department of Siracusa) has recorded significant increases of Not Methanic Hydrocarbons (NMHC) concentrations in air during the days ranging from 30 of April to 2 of March (maximal concentration of 1917 micrograms/m3 detected on 1 of May 2006 at 9:00 hrs) at the air quality monitoring stations of&amp;nbsp; Scala Greca, Priolo e Melilli with peak values measured at Belvedere; no significant concentration increases of other substances were measured for other chemical compounds.&lt;br&gt;The wind conditions contributed significantly in dispersing the combustion gas column towards the sea, with precipitation of the particles far from populated areas. &lt;br&gt;The Inter-company Environmental Protection Consortium (Consorzio Interaziendale protezione ambiente - CIPA) has performed an Environmental Impact Analysis of the event and has established that the average concentration levels of hazardous substances on a three-hourly base never reached the threshold value of 200 micrograms/m3 (ex DPCM n° 30 dated 23 March 1983)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Material damage:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; destruction of the pipelines affected by the fire and explosions, damage to a significant part of the pipe bundle located immediately uphill and downhill to the underway, on a approx. 200 m long section. A approx. 330 m long pipe bundle section has been completely substituted. &lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Damage to the pipe racks immediately adjacent to the subway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Loss of production costs for a total of approx. 110.000.000 Euros have to be added the damage calculation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Offsite:&lt;br&gt;Damage to the asphalt coating of road ex SS114 on a approx. 100 m long section.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Community Disruption:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;road ex SS114 was closed during approx 53 days.&lt;br&gt;Rail road Catania-Siracusa was closed during 48 hours.&lt;br&gt;The ship circulation in the port of Augusta) was interrupted by the port authorities of Augusta during approx. 36 hours.
