It was decided that the shut-down would be an opportunity to conduct some repairs and maintenance and also to monitor the condition of a new equipment configuration that had been recently installed within the regenerator. The catalyst was removed from the base of the generator by a nitrogen assisted steam reduction system until the entry into vessel was possible. The vessel was isolated in preparation (270 blinds had to be inserted before operational procedures allowed entry). The operational procedures that were followed were those that had been successfully used before. Although, it is now realized that they did not take into account the particular set of conditions (that is the large amount of un-regenerated catalyst) in this instance.At approximately 17:30 on Thursday 9, January, fitters started to remove 2 man-way covers on the generator. First a 30\" cover was removed to allow a preliminary visible inspection. No gas tests were made prior to opening as the system was considered to be open to atmosphere because of its flue to the stack. However, the removal of a valve and flow nozzle in the flue duct work may have reduced the draw of the flue on the regenerator and, therefore, contributed to an oxygen deficiency in the regenerator. The first cover was removed without mishap and the fitters proceeded to open a second 60\" man-way which was just being held by 2 bolts and a block and tackle. One bolt was removed when witnesses heard a rumbling noise from inside the regenerator. This was immediately followed by an orange-red flash came out on the left side of the man-way flange engulfing the group of workers on that side. After a few seconds, witnesses heard a seconf loud explosion. It occurred when the pressure wave from the first explosion reached the waste heat boiler (about 30 metres away) connected to the regenerator by a pipework.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;

To allow the access into the regenerator, two man-ways were removed and this provided an oxygen entry which produced an explosive mixture with the gases from the contaminated catalyst. The flammable mixture was then ignited and a confined explosion occurred.\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CAUSES:\n&lt;br&gt;The initial failure of the blowers was caused by vibration to the blower turbine due to loose objects contacting the turbine blades. It has been assumed that these objects came from the actual engineering materials of the turbine itself.\nThe explosion was probably caused by a mixture of hydrogen, light hydrocarbon gases and carbon monoxide. This mixture was either above its auto-ignition temperature during the oxygen entry (when the man-way covers were removed) or was ignited by pyrophoric carbon deposits. The evolution of these gases was stimulated by the action of steam on the un-regenerated catalyst in an poor oxygen atmosphere (this reaction was discovered in subsequent laboratory experiments). This steam was injected immediately after the crash shut-down in an attempt to regenerate the catalyst and keep the catalyst bed fluid. The opening of the man-ways allowed sufficient oxygen enrichment for an explosive mixture in the previously stagnant internal regenerator atmosphere.
