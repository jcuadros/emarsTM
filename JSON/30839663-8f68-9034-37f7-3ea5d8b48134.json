This kind of characteristic means that the explosive substance that caused it was a type at a low speed of explosion, a deflagrating one, like a propellant for rockets (military type) that explodes in the floor in a limited environment;&lt;br&gt;- in the dryer 41 there were 560 Kg of cellulose nitrate, 800/900 Kg of hunting powder , both in the drying phase, and 180 Kg of cellulose nitrate completely dry, the accident destroyed the building creating two craters, the morphology underlines that was a deflagrant substance to generate them;&lt;br&gt;- in the dryer 21N there were 1440 Kg of cellulose nitrate in the drying phase, the accident destroyed the building creating three little craters, the morphology underlines that was a deflagrant substance to generate them;&lt;br&gt;- in the weighing and dosage building 35A there were 1600/1700 Kg of recovery powder and cellulose nitrate, 800/900 Kg of hunting powder , both in the drying phase, and 180 Kg of cellulose nitrate completely dry, the accident destroyed the building creating a crater with a diameter of 10 meters and 3 meters of depth, the morphology underlines that was a deflagrant substance to generate it;&lt;br&gt;- in the building 22F/G 41 there were 3000 Kg of hunting powder in boxes of antistatic polythene, the fire created by the explosion damaged the building structure.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To formulate a reliable hypothesis regarding the cause of the explosions, it is needful to consider:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- in the unit 10C in the room above the crater there was a conspicuous mass of about 600/700 Kg of deflagrant explosive. The room was covered by reinforced concrete and a thick stratus of ground, vegetation and trees. The next rooms were inaccessible because of unusable opening and covered by vegetation. This material was part of the superfluous war escaped from the reclamation of 1997, as they were confined hermetically in the room;&lt;br&gt;- when the explosion occurred, the dryers 41 and 21N were stopped because the guardian of the establishment had switched off the dryer systems one hour before the accident, intercepting any kind of arriving energy (vapour, electric power). The day of the accident was a no - working day indeed it was Sunday (07/28/2002);&lt;br&gt;- the weighing building 35A was inactive and also when it is working, there isn't any kind of power;&lt;br&gt;- before the first explosion there was a \"whistle\" of about 3/4 seconds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the basis of the consideration mentioned above, it is impossible that the first explosion was in one of the structures 41, 21N, 22 F/G or 35A, as there wasn't power to generate the explosion of the stored substances.&lt;br&gt;After a study of the ground around the buildings 10C, 41, 21N, 22F/G and 35A we believe that the first explosion was in the room 10C and the others were caused by the incandescent fragments.&lt;br&gt;As concern the type of explosive exploded in the room 10C and his priming, it is possible to formulate some probable hypothesis:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Explosive type: &lt;br&gt;The exploded mass was composed by deflagrant explosive not inserted in metal boxes. We may say that because of on the strucures nearby the room 10C there weren't marks of splinter, and the crater had a regular morphology, that means that the explosion was linear. If the mass was formed by mortar bombs it would be very different, because of the many continuity solutions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Priming type:&lt;br&gt;The cellulose nitrate and nitroglycerin propellants, as the probable ones of the accident (like propellants for military rockets, never produced in the establishment), during the time they became old, losing the stabilizer. The main substances of the powder begin a dissociation phase, creating an exothermic oxidation that generates HOT SPOTS in the explosive mass. &lt;br&gt;If the warmth in this HOT SPOTS do not disperse in the mass, it may catch fire, creating burning gas and then it may explode. This kind of event is facilitated when the mass is a confined area, as the examined one.&lt;br&gt;The burning gas whizz created before the explosion in the room 10C, it is the \"whistle\" heard before the deflagration.&lt;br&gt;"],"Other":["Yes"]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["c0a7503c-1f33-f15e-bef8-3d8d1cca6de5"],"Consequence_Description":["The accident destroyed two dryers, a weighing and dosage building of the crude substances utilized for the fabrication of cartridges powders and a reinforced concrete building (from the last world war, unused waiting for demolition).&lt;br&gt;As concern the product losses, 2.9 tonnes of pure cellulose nitrate (dry and humid) and 4.6 tonnes of a mixture of cellulose nitrate and nitroglycerin plus various additives (hunting powders) were involved in the accident.&lt;br&gt;As regards the external damages, the establishment ask to the General Assurance to conduct an analysis, they determine that the explosions generate a shock wave that interested a large area of the Castenaso municipality arriving till Bologna municipality and Granarolo.
