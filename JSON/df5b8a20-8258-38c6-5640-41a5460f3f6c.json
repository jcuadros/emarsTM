Redundant equipment and pipework, including drain/vent points, to be removed, where practicable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The HSE investigation also recommended that improvements be made in the following areas of FCCU operation:-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Change control - rigorous change control procedures should be employed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Risk assessment - a review of the FCCU risk assessment should be undertaken which considers critical process effects on start-up, e.g. de-watering, opening FCVs, exceeding process parameters, thermal cycling, transmitted vibration etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Control/instrumentation/electrical equipment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Management review - a high level overview of unit operations should be maintained to ensure abnormal operation of the process plant is identified and the full implications assessed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Communications/competency - process technicians should receive additional training and instructions to enable them to recognise situations where there may be serious implications for process plant. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BP confirmed that these recommendations would be addressed before the FCCU was started up again and would be dealt with in the design of the revamped \"light ends\" section.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Measures to mitigate consequences:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The Competent Authority investigation required that BP should take the following measures before re-introduction of hydrocarbon to the Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) \"light ends\" section. The incident has substantial commercial implications for the site. (The FCCU is currently not operational whilst BP are evaluating the option of re-building the facility).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emergency Shutdown Arrangements&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Demonstration that adequate arrangements have been identified for the emergency shutdown of the \"light ends\" section of the FCCU need to be considered (in particular the following):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;a. Installation of remotely operated shut-off valves (ROSOVs) to allow rapid remote isolation of significant process inventories in order to minimise the consequences of an uncontrolled leak and allow remote emergency shutdown of ancillary equipment, such as pumps;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;b. Safe means for emergency depressurisation of columns or vessels, where reasonably practicable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alarm Flooding&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Demonstration that adequate arrangements have been identified to ensure a timely and effective response by Central Control Building operators to those alarms necessary for the prevention and mitigation of major accidents, taking due account of the number, presentation and rate of presentation of alarms during plant start up, or other upset conditions, and any relevant factors set out in industry best practice guidelines (the Engineering Equipment and Material User's Association (EEMUA) guidelines).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BP has implemented a range of measures to address these issues. Emergency response plans have now been updated to an agreed format and include reference where required to radioactive sources.&amp;nbsp; Storm water tank capacity is being reviewed as part of the Complex sustaining capital programme.&amp;nbsp; Procedures have been established to address the possible release of a range of substances into the effluent treatment plant during a fire or major incident.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BP have reviewed and improved the on-site incident management plan.&amp;nbsp; Area fire plans have been updated to the agreed format. A full review of the on-site emergency support provision has been carried out and improvements to the team organisation and facilities have been implemented.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BP recognised the problems caused by alarm flooding and work had been commenced at the site to address the problem. A project is now under way to put software in place to manage the prioritisation of alarms properly. The projected timescale of 5 years for completion has been accepted by the Competent Authority.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BP also carried out their own investigation into this incident. This resulted in a new site-wide emergency response procedure being issued to address handling asbestos and ceramic fibres during emergencies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Useful References:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The official report into incident \"Major incident investigation report - BP Grangemouth: 29 May - 10 June 2000\" is available at the HSE website at www.hse.gov.uk./comah/bpgrange/index.htm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alarm Handling&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CHIS6 - HSE Information Sheet: Chemicals Sheet No 6 - Better alarm handling&lt;br&gt;To download see www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/chis6.pdf&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EEMUA Guidance - Alarm systems, a guide to design, management and procurement.

The damage to instrumentation during the fire also meant that the control room operator was unable to view the condition of parts of the process through the DCS system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In response to the original identification of the leak, the on-site emergency services were called to attend (03:21 a.m.) and by the time they arrived at the scene, ignition had occurred. They quickly set up portable fire appliances to control the spread of the fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Central Scotland Fire Brigade was notified by a 999 call at 03:29 a.m. following the ignition. They arrived at the scene at 03.39 a.m. and assisted in controlling the incident. The fire was initially attended by five mobile units along with a decontamination and control unit. Subsequently a further five mobile units attended with a standby foam tanker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 03.33 a.m. the Oil Refinery muster point alarm was sounded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Plant operators helped the emergency services by closing manual valves (for example at the fractionator column) and by shutting down pumps to minimise the quantity of material released. The control room operator was limited in the extent to which he could assist to isolate inventories remotely because many isolations could only be done manually.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BP Grangemouth Incident Management Team was called out and within 30 minutes the Grangemouth Petrochemical Complex Major Incident Control Committee (MICC) had been activated at Grangemouth police station. Some difficulties were experienced with the reception of emergency responders and with MICC communications. Control of the access to the incident site was initially difficult to achieve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fire reached its maximum intensity within 20 minutes but within 40 minutes started to decline as a result of a reduction in available fuel and the use of aggressive fire-fighting techniques (water and foam). Within 90 minutes the fire size had reduced considerably to the point where the remaining inventory could be allowed to burn off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The incident was brought under control and several hours later (around 10:00 a.m.) the incident was declared to be over. Damage was mainly limited to columns and associated equipment on the \"light ends\" section in the vicinity of column E5. Passive structural fire protection prevented significant damage to surrounding structures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the initial incident response, consideration was not given to the potential asbestos hazard to fire-fighting teams. It was only later that it was suspected that asbestos from vessel/piping insulation may have become damaged either directly by the fire or by the fire-fighting attempts and tests were carried out to determine the extent (if any) of the asbestos contamination. Whilst most of the asbestos was retained on the plant, some asbestos material was subsequently found in the plant drains, most probably as a result of having been deposited by firewater.&amp;nbsp; There was no evidence of air-borne asbestos having been deposited outside the plant area. For a summary of the key findings of the investigation into the response to asbestos concerns see the asbestos investigation in the HSE report at www.hse.gov.uk/comah/bpgrange/invest/index.htm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gas sampling carried out on the north bank of the River Forth found no abnormal levels of atmospheric pollutants following the incident. Towards the end of the incident, due to the large quantity of water used for fire-fighting, and the fact that the capacity of the storm water tanks was effectively reduced by recent heavy rain, the storm water tanks in the Oil Refinery effluent treatment system became filled. Contaminated effluent from the FCCU containing hydrocarbon liquids was diverted directly into the Forth Estuary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BP made the plant safe by isolating sections of the plant using existing valves and then by determining how to safely dispose of inventories of flammable material. There was substantial damage to high-level steelwork and access to parts of the site of the fire was restricted until the danger from falling steelwork had been assessed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The FCCU is currently not operational whilst BP are evaluating the option of re-building the facility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a summary of the key findings of the investigation into the environmental impact of the FCCU fire see the environmental impact investigation in the HSE report at www.hse.gov.uk/comah/bpgrange/invest/response.htm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Official action taken - legal action: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The HSE alleged breaches of health and safety law and BP Grangemouth Oil Refinery Limited were served with an indictment for breaches of the Health &amp;amp; Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 Section 2. The company was found guilty and fined Â£750,000.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An Improvement Notice was served on the company relating to asbestos management.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Official action taken - other action: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following this incident (and two other non-reportable incidents which occurred at the same establishment between 29 May and 10 June 2000), the UK's Health and Safety Commission and Health and Safety Executive (HSE) agreed that the HSE would prepare a non-statutory report on the incidents and would make it available to the public in accordance with the HSE's policies. The&amp;nbsp; \"Major incident investigation report - BP Grangemouth: 29 May - 10 June 2000\" (available at the HSE website at www.hse.gov.uk/comah/bpgrange/index.htm) explains how and why the incidents occurred, and summarises the subsequent investigations carried out by the Competent Authority and by BP.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The report seeks to reassure the public that a series of thorough and detailed investigations into the causes of the incidents have been carried out by all parties concerned. In addition the report is intended to demonstrate that a number of lessons have been learned both by BP and by the regulators, and actions have been taken in order to improve safety performance at the complex. The report is also intended to be viewed by a wider audience of companies, safety professionals and Trade Union representatives involved in the major accident hazard industries and to serve as a reminder of many of the issues that need to be addressed by safety reports for major hazard installations. Operators of major hazard sites are expected to carefully consider the contents of this report and the HSE will use Trade Association contacts, plus site inspection plans and other means, to publicise the incidents and to ensure the lessons are widely learned.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastUser":{"UserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"Name":["MINERVA"],"Surname":["Administrator"],"IsVisibleSensibleData":[false]},"LastDate":["2017-07-11T15:59:38.731"],"ParentCompany":{},"Region":{},"Province":{},"City":{},"PostCode":{},"Concurrency":[0]},"LockedUserId":{},"LockedDate":{},"IsLocked":[false],"IsLockedByMe":[false],"LockedUser":{}},"AccidentProfile_Tab":{"ReportingAuthority":{},"ContactPerson":{},"Reasons":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Substances involved: greater than 5% of quantity in Column 3 of Annex I"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Injury to persons: &gt;= 1 fatalities, &gt;= 6 hospitalizing injuries etc."},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Immediate damage to the environment (according to Annex VI)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Damage to property: on-site &gt;2M &amp;euro;, off-site &gt; 0.5M &amp;euro;"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"Cross-border damage: transboundary accidents"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"Interesting for lessons learned."}],"AffectedCountries":{}},"AccidentDescription_Tab":{"AccidentDescription":{"DominoEffects":[false],"NatechEvents":[false],"TransboundaryEffects":[false],"Contractors":[false],"accTypeRelease":[0],"accTypeFire":[0],"accTypeExplosion":[0],"accTypeTransport":[0],"accTypeOther":{},"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastDate":["2017-07-11T16:00:08.689"],"Concurrency":[0],"Translation":{"VersionId":["0b0983a9-b6c8-7b5a-8269-a7ab602ad1ae"],"LanguageId":["EN"],"AccidentDescription":["Loss of containment of approximately 11.5 tonnes of flammable hydrocarbons at elevated temperature, following the failure of a 3\" branch on transfer line between fractionation columns, on fluidised catalytic cracker unit recovery section. The release ignited and the subsequent fire caused extensive damage to the plant.  No serious injuries.\n &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discussion about the occurrence:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the evening of the 9th June the Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) was in the process of being restarted. The \"front end\" (see Figure A) i.e. the cracking section was started up successfully by about midnight. The intention was to then start the \"back end\" Vapour Recovery Unit (VRU or \"light ends\" section) (see Figure B) of the plant by progressively introducing hydrocarbons into each of the columns in turn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main fractionator and absorber columns were successfully brought on line and then material was introduced into the Debutaniser column (E5) sometime after 01.00 a.m.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At this stage the control room operator had difficulty in achieving the correct temperature and pressure at the base of the column E5 and this resulted in the relief valves lifting. Problems were also experienced in maintaining the correct levels in the next column downstream (the Re-run column E6) due to gas being present in the pump which controlled the liquid levels in the column. This was a common problem experienced during start up conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During start-up and before transferring liquids from E5 to E6, standard operating practice for plant operators is to dewater the transfer line using a number of drain points on the system. Dewatering is essential because if the water in E5 (which is operated at a high temperature and pressure relative to the conditions in the column E6) was transferred into E6 it would result in the water immediately \"flashing off\" to produce steam. The transition between liquid and vapour phases is accompanied by significant volumetric changes and this could potentially damage the Re-run column E6.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to dewater the column a drain point at the base of the column E5 on the outlet pipework is opened and water is allowed to escape to the local ground drains until hydrocarbons are observed coming out. This operation is carried out several times prior to transfer commencing in order to ensure that all the water has been removed. The hydrocarbons discharged to the drain system are subsequently removed in the effluent treatment systems for the Complex and are not discharged off-site.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following the dewatering procedure the transfer of liquid from the base of column E5 to column E6 was initiated by the control room operator at about 03.15 a.m. This was achieved by opening a flow control valve in a 6\" transfer line between the two columns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At approximately 03.19 a.m. operators working on the plant in the vicinity of the Debutaniser column reported a leak of hydrocarbons (described as a white vapour smelling of \"spirit\") coming from the base of E5 and drifting northwards towards the hot oil pumphouse. The control room operator was notified of the leak and immediately stopped the feed to the unit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At approximately 03.23 a.m. whilst the plant operators were investigating the source of the leak and beginning to isolate valves, the release ignited and the operators ran quickly to a place of safety. A serious fire developed at the base of E5 and this then had an impact on the adjacent columns and equipment. There were no injuries as a result of the incident. The fire was automatically detected by a fire detector located in the Hot Oil pump house facing the debutaniser column E5, which alerted the Control Room.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The control room operator isolated the feeds to the \"light ends\" system using the distributed control system (DCS) and within two minutes, despite the number of audible and visual alarms significant isolation of inventories had taken place. The damage to instrumentation during the fire also meant that the control room operator was unable to view the condition of parts of the process through the DCS system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The prevailing wind direction at the time of the incident took the vapours into a relatively open area of the plant where the vapours were able to disperse relatively easily.

On 10th June 2000 at approximately 03:20 a.m. during start up procedures which commenced on 9th June there was a significant leak of hydrocarbons from the FCCU creating a vapour cloud which ignited resulting in a serious fire. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The cause of the leak was subsequently found to be the fracture of an unsupported&amp;nbsp; 6 x 3\" reducing tee branch pipe to the main transfer line due to fatigue failure. Between spring 1998 and June 2000 there was an increased number of start ups and shut downs on the Vapour Recovery Unit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Further, a number of incidents had occurred during the two years prior to this incident in which vibration was a relevant issue - for details see the HSE report at the HSE website at www.hse.gov.uk./comah/bpgrange/incident/page14/.htm#Effects&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following the last major revamp project in 1998 the FCCU had been experiencing considerable difficulties and had not been able to operate consistently. This was due to a combination of technical problems with the \"front end\" catalyst handling section and other issues such as loss of utility supplies (steam, power etc.). This had resulted in the plant being subjected to numerous start-ups and shutdowns over the intervening two-year period and especially during the few months preceding the fire. In the 11 weeks preceding the incident, 19 start-up attempts had been made, of which 7 reached the stage of starting to bring the Vapour Recovery Unit on line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FCCU start-ups are periods of intense activity for the operators whilst the plant is brought up to the steady-state design and normal operating conditions from ambient and hydrocarbons are gradually introduced into the system. This requires significant manual involvement to open/close valves as necessary on the plant as well as assistance from the control room operators monitoring the plant from the plant distributed control system (DCS).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Starting up a process unit results in significant changes (operating temperature and pressure etc.) on the pipework and vessels as they are brought up to the required operating conditions from ambient. Increasing the frequency of start-ups results in fluctuations in conditions and increased cyclic stresses on mechanical systems as a result of these. Under such cyclic conditions the pipework can become \"fatigued\" with defects developing that can subsequently lead to failure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"Other":["Yes"]}},"SiteStorageMajors":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"process-associated (stockholding, etc. on-site of

There was no evidence of air-borne asbestos having been deposited outside the plant area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall the investigation concluded that no significant environmental consequences were identified.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Community Disruption:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although this incident did not directly affect the local population, it did cause significant local concern, as it was the third in a series of incidents which occurred at the site in a very short period of time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following this incident (and two other non-reportable incidents which occurred at the same establishment between 29 May and 10 June 2000), the UK's Health and Safety Commission and Health and Safety Executive (HSE) agreed that the HSE would prepare a non-statutory report on the incidents and would make it available to the public in accordance with the HSE's policies. The&amp;nbsp; \"Major incident investigation report - BP Grangemouth: 29 May - 10 June 2000\"&amp;nbsp; (available at the HSE website at www.hse.gov.uk/comah/bpgrange/index.htm) explains how and why the incidents occurred and summarises the subsequent investigations carried out by the Competent Authority and by BP.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The report seeks to reassure the public that a series of thorough and detailed investigations into the causes of the incidents have been carried out by all parties concerned. In addition, the report is intended to demonstrate that a number of lessons have been learned both by BP and by the regulators and actions have been taken in order to improve safety performance at the Complex. The report is also intended to be viewed by a wider audience of companies, safety professionals and Trade Union representatives involved in the major accident hazard industries and to serve as a reminder of many of the issues that need to be addressed by safety reports for major hazard installations. Operators of major hazard sites are expected to carefully consider the contents of this report and the HSE will use Trade Association contacts, plus site inspection plans and other means, to publicise the incidents and to ensure the lessons are widely learned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discussion of the Consequences:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The fire developed on the Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) at the base of E5 and had an impact on the adjacent columns and equipment. There were no injuries as a result of the incident.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The prevailing wind direction at the time of the incident took the vapours into a relatively open area of the plant where the vapours were able to disperse relatively easily. If, however, the wind had been in a different direction, towards an area where there was a congestion of plant and equipment and ignition had occurred, the consequences may have been more serious. Such a scenario had previously been identified in the BP CIMAH/COMAH safety reports for the FCCU whereby the possibility of a vapour cloud explosion (VCE) had been considered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fire reached its maximum intensity within 20 minutes but within 40 minutes started to decline as a result of a reduction in available fuel and the use of aggressive fire-fighting techniques (water and foam). Within 90 minutes the fire size had reduced considerably to the point where the remaining inventory could be allowed to burn off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The incident was brought under control and several hours later (around 10:00 a.m.) the incident was declared to be over. Damage was mainly limited to columns and associated equipment on the \"light ends\" section in the vicinity of column E5. Passive structural fire protection prevented significant damage to surrounding structures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the initial incident response, consideration was not given to the potential asbestos hazard to fire-fighting teams. It was only later that it was suspected that asbestos from vessel/piping insulation may have become damaged, either directly by the fire or by the fire-fighting attempts, and tests were carried out to determine the extent (if any) of the asbestos contamination. Whilst most of the asbestos was retained on the plant, some asbestos material was subsequently found in the plant drains, most probably as a result of having been deposited by firewater.&amp;nbsp; There was no evidence of air-borne asbestos having been deposited outside the plant area. For a summary of the key findings of the investigation into the response to asbestos concerns following the FCCU fire see the HSE report at www.hse.gov.uk/comah/bpgrange/invest/index.htm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gas sampling carried out on the north bank of the River Forth found no abnormal levels of atmospheric pollutants following the incident. For a summary of the key findings of the investigation into the environmental impact of the FCCU fire see the HSE report at www.hse.gov.uk/comah/bpgrange/invest/impact.htm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Towards the end of the incident, due to the large quantity of water used for fire-fighting, and the fact that the capacity of the storm water tanks was effectively reduced by recent heavy rain, the storm water tanks in the Oil Refinery effluent treatment system became filled. Contaminated effluent from the FCCU containing hydrocarbon liquids was diverted directly into the Forth Estuary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BP made the plant safe by isolating sections of the plant using existing valves and then by determining how to safely dispose of inventories of flammable material. There was substantial damage to high level steelwork and access to parts of the site of the fire was restricted until the danger from falling steelwork had been assessed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"Human":[1],"Environmental":[1],"Cost":[1],"Disruption":[0]},"HumanOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","Effect":"Establishment Population: 5","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"HumanOffSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"DetailHumanOffSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Establishment total at risk","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"immediate fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"subsequent fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"hospitalizing injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other serious injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"health monitoring","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true}],"DetailHumanOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Establishment total at risk","Quantity":5,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"immediate fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"subsequent fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"hospitalizing injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other serious injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"health monitoring","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true}],"DetailHumanEmergency":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Establishment total at risk","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"immediate fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"subsequent fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"hospitalizing injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other serious injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"health monitoring","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true}],"EnvironmentalOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"inland: metropolitan development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"inland: urban development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"inland: rural development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"inland: parkland/commonland","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"inland: grassland/pasture/meadow","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"inland: arable land/crops/vineyards/orchards","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"inland: woodland;
