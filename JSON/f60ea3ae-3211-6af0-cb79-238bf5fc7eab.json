Atmospheric Stability Class: D. Wind speed = 2m/sec (data given by the company).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The accident occurred between 11:40 and 11:50 a.m. at the upper level of the building at the pesticide plant, in the water-bath used for pre-heating barrels of raw materials. The pre-heating at 40รถ50oC of the contents of the barrels was carried out by means of hot water, which in turn was directly heated by steam supplied by a steam coil (the coil diameter was 5 cm whilst the diameter of the holes of the coil was 0.5 cm). According to the standard operating procedures, the operator had to be always present in the installation and to control the temperature of the raw material. The temperature control had to be carried out by checking the water temperature by means of a hand thermometer and by switching-off the steam valve. The heating of the water was allowed for a period of 2รถ2.5 hours as maximum, since long operating experience had shown that this period of time was sufficient to reach a raw material temperature of about 40oC. The day of the accident dimethoate (14 barrels each containing 124 Kg of material) and parathion-methyl (6 barrels each containing 260 Kg of material) had to be heated. Despite of the standard operating instructions, the operator forgot to switch-off the steam valve of the line heating up the water of the bath. Thus, the heating time of the water of the bath and the barrels was extended for at least one hour. As a result of the overheating, the overpressure generated by the vapours production in the closed barrels, caused the detonation of the caps of three barrels containing dimethoate. As a result of the explosion (probably due to the friction between the caps and the bodies of the barrels), a fire of dimethoate occurred with subsequent emission of NOx, SOx and mercaptans. The fire was then followed by the detonation of the caps in other six barrels containing dimethoate. In order to avoid pollution of sea water by fire fighting extinguishing water (because its flow rate was too high and the pump which had to send it to the main waste water treatment plsnt was not adequate), the overflow was trapped in a pool made out of gypsum and limestone. It is under juridical investigation if the water used to extinguish the fire was totally treated in the wastewater treatment plant and in the pool made out of gypsum and limestone or if it was partly released to the sea.

As a result of the overheating, the overpressure generated by the vapours production in the closed barrels, caused the detonation of the caps of three barrels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Further uninvestigation revealed that:&lt;br&gt;Despite of the standard operating instructions for the pre-heating of dimethoate, the operator forgot to switch-off the steam valve (codes 5303 and 5401) heating up the water of the bath and the overpressure, due to the vapours produced in the closed barrels, caused the detonation of the caps of three barrels (code 5102). The plant design and process analysis were inadequate because the heating of the water bath was carried out directly with steam and not with hot water (codes 5307 and 5308).&lt;br&gt;"],"Other":[""]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["141f8c5a-7a51-a6cc-ce33-f240691661c8"],"Consequence_Description":["EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:&lt;br&gt;According the dispersion model developped by the Laboratory of Physics of the Environment of a University, the combustion products of dimethoate reached (for SOx) a maximum concentration of 1.75 mg/mc at a distance of 100 metres from the water-bath (the maximum permissible concentration in the working environment is 5.32 mg/mc).
