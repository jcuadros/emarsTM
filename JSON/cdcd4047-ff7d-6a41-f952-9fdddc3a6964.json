Within a short time of the event, blast furnace personnel had established a large water seal at the gas system to isolate the furnace from the downstream gas systems. The water supply from the Energy Department was isolated. The furnace was vented through its flare stack and bleeder valves.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The on-site and off-site emergency plans were initiated, and Fire, Police and Ambulance services soon had a strong presence on site.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The furnace area was cordoned off by the Police to limit access.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Control centres were set up at the scene and at Port Talbot Police Station.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Local government facilities were used to keep relatives and members of the public informed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Overall emergency response was acceptable, and an early review of the emergency response has generated improvement plans.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The structural stability of the furnace and its associated plant was a matter&amp;nbsp;of immediate concern.

Once necessary forensic examinations had been completed, the 'quenched' burden and the refractory materials within the furnace body were removed.

The immediate effect of this furnace over-pressure was to lift that part of the structure above the lap joint upwards, the furnace lintel rising up off the column heads normally supporting the furnace. It is estimated that the structure above the lap joint rose by some 0.75 m. This structure, with its associated burden, was estimated to weigh around 5000 tonnes. The lifting of the upper part of the furnace left an opening of approximately 400-600 mm around the entire circumference at lap joint level. Gases and hot materials were ejected horizontally from this opening. During the period that this gap remained open, some 200 tonnes of liquid, solid, and semi-solid material were ejected onto the cast house floor. Gaseous material and dust rose into the cast house, exited through various openings in the building and into the atmosphere, where much of it ignited. A cloud of ignited dust and gaseous material was thrown several hundred feet into the air above the furnace. The furnace-top ‘bleeder’ valves also opened and discharged into the atmosphere. Gases from these valves also ignited.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The furnace then fell back down vertically as the pressure decreased. During the explosion it had twisted (anticlockwise) through approximately 20–50 mm and moved a distance off-centre of about 100 mm, leaving it supported on the lower lap joint plate, with the lintel mounting positions no longer in contact with the column top flanges but instead some 50–100 mm above the column tops. This meant that the weight of the furnace stack was resting, eccentrically, on the lower lap-joint plate.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There was little or no warning to personnel working on the cast house floor, although some witnesses later spoke of the event being preceded by ‘rumbles’ within the furnace moments before the actual explosion. At the time of the explosion there were three employees actually on the furnace stack, and several employees and contractors in the cast house floor area. Three employees were within a few metres of the tap hole, with several in the ‘jump desk’ (control room).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For more details, See the full report on the incident&amp;nbsp;- &lt;A href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/web34.pdf\"&gt;http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/web34.pdf&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;

It consisted of a large (circa 90 metre) vessel supported on heavy steel columns. It was constructed in two sections, the top half having limited vertical movement on a lap joint with the bottom half. The furnace had a 3.5 cm thick outer shell and a refractory lining in which were inserted approximately 1,400 copper coolers. Water was pumped through the coolers to remove heat.&amp;nbsp;It was capable of containing approximately 2,000 tonnes of burden (iron ore, coke and limestone) and had 24 tuyeres (nozzles) located at the base just above the hearth. Typically this process involves hot air being blasted into the bottom of the furnace through the tuyeres (capable of delivering 180 cubic metres of hot blast per hour), leading to the production of several thousand tonnes of iron per day. The oxygen in the air combusts with the coke to form carbon monoxide and generates a lot of heat. The carbon monoxide flows up through the blast furnace and removes the oxygen from the iron ores on their way down, thereby leaving iron. The heat within the furnace melts the iron and the resulting liquid is tapped (removed) at regular&amp;nbsp; intervals by opening a hole in the bottom of the furnace and allowing it to flow out.

The immediate cause was the mixing of water and hot materials within the lower part of the furnace; the precise mechanism remains a matter that is not fully understood.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The water had entered the furnace from its cooling system following a chain of events initiated by the failure of safety critical water cooling systems. At the time of the explosion, attempts were continuing to recify the abnormal operating conditions that this had created and to recover the furnace.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The precursors to the explosion were a combination of significant failures in health and safety management extending over many years. These failures were not confined solely to the blast furnace plant; they extended elsewhere within the company, and in particular to the Energy Department which supported essential cooling water for the furnace.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A failure to carry out suitable risk assessments for blast furnace operations resulted in the failure to implement robust technical and procedural controls. There was insufficient redundancy and security of cooling water supplies, and overall cooling system reliability showed a downward and deteriorating trend over several months.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For more details, See the full report on the incident&amp;nbsp;- &lt;A href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/web34.pdf\"&gt;http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/web34.pdf&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;"],"Other":[""]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["bbf80b2e-ea3b-0067-7f2b-70b53ffeaeb1"],"Consequence_Description":["&lt;FONT face=HelveticaNeue-Light size=2&gt;&lt;FONT face=HelveticaNeue-Light size=2&gt;\r\n&lt;P align=left&gt;Three employees were killed and 12 employees and contractors&amp;nbsp;sustained severe injuries.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some of the injured&amp;nbsp;remained in intensive care for several months.

The injuries arose from blast effects, with burns from hot water and steam and the hot gases and dust ejected.

The lifting of the furnace body caused considerable disruption to all its services and associated plant. The furnace structure immediately after the accident was no longer supported directly upon its structural columns and was therefore in a potentially unstable condition.&amp;nbsp;Hot materials comprising molten slag, molten iron, partially reacted coke, sinter and unreacted coke, together with larger lumps of agglomerated burden material, had been ejected through the open lap joint&amp;nbsp;damaging the blast wall immediately behind the west side of the furnace. Subsequently, furnace burden penetrated into the water manifold/launder area and into the hydraulic room destroying the water manifold and damaging the wall of the hydraulic room beyond. Penetration of molten burden through a doorway into the amenities block initiated a significant fire which caused serious damage.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The profiled steel cladding of the building was severely damaged in several areas, with some sheets being projected in excess of 40 m. Molten slag was thrown over most of the cast house floor and flowed as far as the entrance ramp to an estimated depth of between 300 and 600 mm. There was no penetration of solid material into the control room, although there was impact damage to its front.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Areas where gas plant structures had moved significantly were identified after the accident, but gas containment was maintained and there was no major blast furnace gas leakage from the downstream gas system. Significant amounts of flame and gas were, however, emitted through the furnace top bleeders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subsequent engineering evaluation by&amp;nbsp;engineering personnel deemed the furnace to be beyond repair and it&amp;nbsp;was demolished and rebuilt to a more modern design – one which does not feature a lap joint.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Although disruption to the community was relatively minor, with local traffic being affected on the night and local government facilities used as information centres for employees and their relatives, the exposion caused widespread alarm and concern throughout the locality.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There was no damage to the environment.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The company was subsequently prosecuted under sections 2(1) and 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 and was fined £1.33 million, with £1.74 million costs also being awarded.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;"],"Human":[1],"Environmental":[0],"Cost":[1],"Disruption":[1]},"HumanOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","Quantity":3,"Effect":"3","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","Quantity":12,"Effect":"12 employees and contractors sustained severe injuries.
