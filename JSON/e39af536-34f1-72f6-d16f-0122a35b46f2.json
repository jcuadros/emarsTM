The release occurred because the pH value of the solution was too low and too much sodium sulphide was added. The two workers were killed. The initial concentration of the released gas was at least 1000 ppm.\n1999, the initiating event was the addition of solid phase sodium\nsulphide to liquid phase spent pickling solutions, which had far too\nlow a pH value. The intention was to precipitate heavy metals in the\nsolution. However, the very low pH value induced formation of hydrogen\nsulphide gas rather than precipitation of heavy metals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[TEXT 1]\nOn the afternoon of the 9th of may 1995, there was a release of hydrogen sulphide gas at a plant, which resulted in the death of two process workers.
