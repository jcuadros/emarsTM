The process comprises 4 steps:&lt;br&gt;Step 1 - mononitration&lt;br&gt;Step 2 - reductive alkylation of 4-nitroxylene&lt;br&gt;Step 3 - dinitration of the intermediate&lt;br&gt;Step 4 - purification and washing of the Pendimethalin.&lt;br&gt;The accident occurred during step 3 in the nitric acid concentration section and involved the distillation column C320 and the dedicated reboiler E320, connected to the column by natural circulation.&lt;br&gt;The cause of the accident is still under investigation by the competent judicial authorities; however, based on the declarations of the company, it can be supposed that the event initiated with the bursting of the bottom of the distillation column and the reboiler connected to the same column. The blast wave consequent to the explosion hurled one of the two road tankers parked nearby on a second road tanker. The road tanker hurled by the blast wave contained nitric acid with a ca. 40% concentration, resulting from the purging of the column bottom, whereas the road tanker which was hit was empty. The projection of missiles on the plant structures consequent to the explosion caused among other consequences, also cracks on the tank containing nitric acid and its release. A fire developed also affecting only the immediate surroundings of the explosion within a radius of a few metres, according to an estimate based on the effects left by the flames. According to the estimates of the company, the smoke column produced by the fire reached a height of 20 metres and&amp;nbsp; shifted towards a nearby highway. The process substances and residues which were released by the explosion, were subsequently washed away by the extinguishing water used by the Finchimica fire brigade and were collected in the final emergency containment basin, with a capacity of ca. 1.600 m= (1400m= were collected following the accident), the plant personnel put the basin immediately into service for the successive treatment in the sewage treatment plant. During the collecting phase of the extinguishing water in the basin, a not perfectly closed interception valve allowed a certain amount of the extinguishing water to leak into the municipal sewage system and from there into an open air channel named \"colatore Moloncello\". Tests have been performed on samples taken from the affected water systems and the results are still under evaluation by the competent territorial authorities: however, from what is known to the company, there is no visible damage to the surrounding flora.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;

Concerning the evolution of the released combustion gases, the ASL, which intervened on a call of the 118 emergency response service, established, as declared in its report, the \"absence of a continuous diffusion of combustion gases in the atmosphere\".\nTechnicians of the SOPI (Operative Structure for Emergency Response of the ASL) carried out the necessary tests \"excluding the presence in the atmosphere of nitric acid, combustion gases as COx, NOx, SOx, hydrocyanic acid, and all other organic substances with a xylene infrared absorption spectrum.\nThe ASL itself has taken waste water samples (processing water, extinguishing water, etc.) for analysis; the results are under evaluation by the competent authorities.\nConcerning material damage, the accident caused on-site consequences as well as off-site consequences.\nOn-site the installation:\n- \"building 1 and 2\" with damage to equipment and structures,\n- the two road tankers affected by the blast wave and missile projection are out of service,\n- the control room of the office building with damages to the external walls, windows, and in the control room damage to the ceiling panelling.\nIn a more detailed way, in the control room windows and ceiling panelling were damaged by the pressure wave. The external walls were damaged by missiles projections of structural elements from buildings 1 and 2.\nThe largest metal fragment found weighs 120-130 kg.\nA missile  pierced the external metallic fence of the liquid hydrogen storage tank located ca. 60 m from the explosion point, without damaging the tank itself because it was shielded by building 2. Moreover the blast wave, which  expanded mostly on the N-S axis which was not protected by large buildings  reached also, apart from the already mentioned control room, the laboratory building and the management office building some 150 m away, causing the rupture of windows in both of them.\nOff-site, within a radius of 400 m, a few buildings were affected by rupture of windows and some missile projection. Metallic fragments were found onsite within a radius of 100 m and some others over the enclosure wall within a distance of 40-60 m from the wall (perforations with a maximum size of some dozen cm).\nIn a more detailed way concerning off-site consequences, using the establishment as orientation point:\n- eastwards, highway and mainly agricultural land, no damage has been reported until now.\n- northwards, two farm buildings, the first at a distance of 120 m, suffered broken windows, whereas the second, at a distance of 220 m, did not suffer any damage.\n- westwards, some private buildings and some installations being part of the industrial area, broken windows were reported.\n- southwards toll-gate of the highway (ca. 100 m) and the industrial area, no damage was reported.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ecological Harm - Remarks:&lt;br&gt;As already mentioned before, the territorial competent ASL is analysing the drawn water samples, in order to define the extent and magnitude of damage caused by the release of extinguishing water into the sewage system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Affected Area: installation&lt;br&gt;Affected Area: establishment&lt;br&gt;Affected Area: off-site: local&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"Human":[1],"Environmental":[1],"Cost":[1],"Disruption":[1]},"HumanOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","Effect":"Establishment Population: 9","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"HumanOffSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","Effect":"Emergency Personnel : 9 OffSite Population : 25","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"DetailHumanOffSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Establishment total at risk","Quantity":25,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"immediate fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"subsequent fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"hospitalizing injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other serious injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"health monitoring","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true}],"DetailHumanOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Establishment total at risk","Quantity":9,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"immediate fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"subsequent fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"hospitalizing injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other serious injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"health monitoring","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true}],"DetailHumanEmergency":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Establishment total at risk","Quantity":9,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"immediate fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"subsequent fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"hospitalizing injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other serious injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"health monitoring","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true}],"EnvironmentalOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"inland: metropolitan development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"inland: urban development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"inland: rural development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"inland: parkland/commonland","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"inland: grassland/pasture/meadow","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"inland: arable land/crops/vineyards/orchards","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"inland: woodland;
