The occurrence of 26 June 2004 has indeed raised questions regarding the formal implementation of the Onsite Emergency Response Plan.&lt;br&gt;It is also worth asking certain questions regarding the balance between the staff allocated to the production units and those needed for emergency response operations in case of an accident occurring. This aspect takes on particular importance outside working hours.&lt;br&gt;In view of the human consequences of the fire of 26 June 2004, the decision was taken, at the request of the CHSCT, to repair the paving of the HDS unit. It would seem desirable to extend this measure to the whole of the plant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspection plan:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rupture of the tube that started the fire was a consequence of certain types of deterioration (coke deposit, attack by polythionic acids), which were not identified when the inspection plan was drawn up with the aid of the RBeye software program used by the Group.&lt;br&gt;Further development of this tool would thus seem necessary so that it includes the modes of deterioration mentioned above and to take the age of the equipment into account in the criticality calculations. &lt;br&gt;Deterioration of the tubes may also become apparent during hydraulic strength tests, provided the equipment is subjected to greater stresses than those occurring in normal service. If the initial strength test applied to the oven newly rebuilt in accordance with the decree of 13 December 1999 is suitable for addressing this concern, steps should be taken to ensure that this condition applies for similar ageing equipment.&lt;br&gt;To verify the relevance of these measures, it might be interesting to make a comparison of the inspection plans for these units currently implemented in French refineries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;External communication:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the crisis management operations, the information given by the operator concerning the gravity and the potential consequences of the accident, were considered as to be inadequate by the offsite services (Town Hall, Police, Emergency Response Services, Director of Sports Infrastructures, etc.).&lt;br&gt;The operator, on the other hand, considers that the measures taken by the Authorities where exaggerated with regards to the nature of the occurrence. In terms of communication, a press conference was held by the director of the site on 26 June 2004 , the day of the accident, at 18.30.&lt;br&gt;These diverging evaluations were examined after the event in a debriefing meeting at the Prefecture of the Rh√¥ne, which concluded that there was a need: &lt;br&gt;- to improve the organization of crisis management between the Town Hall of Feyzin, the Police Authorities and the refinery,&lt;br&gt;- for the operator, to formalize in his alert procedures the notion of \"events visible from the outside\", comprising a fast, systematic means of informing the Authorities, even in cases where the Onsite Emergency Plan is not activated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"EmergencyResponce_Descr":["The DRIRE launched an immediate administrative inquiry on 26 June 2004. Numerous contacts were made and meetings and dialogues organized by the departments in charge of the regulation of pressurized systems and those in charge of environmental questions, both local and regional.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a view to identifying the causes of this accident and taking the steps for restarting the HDS unit without risk, a Prefectoral order prescribing emergency measures, dated 30 June 2004, was communicated to the operator at the instigation of the DRIRE.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Analysis of failures and causes:&lt;br&gt;An examination of the chronology of the event (recordings of the alarm, of sensors, movements of valves, etc.), a description of possible advance indications and the list of special operations carried out in the course of the day were presented. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Essentially, the following points emerge:&lt;br&gt;- no irregularity in the process parameters before the accident and no warning sign is revealed by the analysis of the operation parameters of the HDS unit,&lt;br&gt;- no malfunction in the automatic control and safety devices (independent systems) was identified.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The failures and causes analysis was carried out by a multidisciplinary internal working group. The work session was steered by an expert guaranteeing the correct application of the fault-tree model, and who had not been involved in the management of the accident in question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Plant:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Checks and inspections were carried out on the equipment of the reactor loop downstream from the oven (reactor 42R202, exchangers 42E201 and 42E202A/B) which suffered abrupt decompression when the tube of the oven ruptured, although normal operation provides for the application of a very gradual depressurization procedure. Because of this, the internal cladding coatings (an internal cladding skin applied to the welding seams) or stainless steel double skins could have suffered a phenomenon of adhesion failure (disbonding by the hydrogen). No such anomaly was revealed.&lt;br&gt;- the chimney, which had flames issuing from its top for several minutes, was subjected to thermographic checks, visual inspections of the crown by telescope and verification of verticality. It results that the concrete structure and its internal cladding (refractory brick) are in satisfactory condition and in conformity with construction specifications.&lt;br&gt;- 34 lines were checked: &lt;br&gt;o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; the pipework in zones 5 and 6, mainly the combustible and utility supplies to the oven, were replaced or eliminated (the new oven changed over to fuel gas only),&lt;br&gt;o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; the loading and transfer lines of the oven situated in zone 5, together with all the pipework on the eastern rack and on the ground were not metallurgically affected by the fire because of their heat-insulation protection. The remedial work consisted of replacement of the bolting, joints, heat insulation and its protective metal sheeting, and the spring supports, &lt;br&gt;- all the electrical cabling and measurement systems were completely overhauled, with replacement of damaged components,&lt;br&gt;- all the valves and pumps were overhauled,&lt;br&gt;- the water curtain systems of ovens 42F201 and 42F501 were entirely rebuilt, &lt;br&gt;- the gas detectors were overhauled and replaced where necessary.&lt;br&gt;- In view of the extent of the damage to the oven, the decision was taken to rebuild it new together with the associated civil engineering works (concrete support columns, first section of the flue). The reconstruction was almost identical to the original, though the following improvements were incorporated: &lt;br&gt;o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 6 burners fitted instead of 4, enabling better distribution of the heat flow,&lt;br&gt;o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; remote ignition device for the burners included,&lt;br&gt;o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; temperature sensors fitted on the outer skins of the tubes at two levels in the radiation part, and similarly on the lower layer of the convection part, for the purpose of monitoring any abnormal temperature increases that might be caused by build-up of coke in the inside,&lt;br&gt;o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; inclusion of supplementary man holes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspection plan:&lt;br&gt;The inspection plan of the oven was revised to take into account the initial conclusions drawn from the expert examination, and provides for the following additional checks, made possible by the new design of the equipment: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the convection part:&lt;br&gt;o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; replica tests and radiography of the convection tubes once per cycle, &lt;br&gt;o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; at the next major shut-down in 2007 (after 25 000 h of operation): measurements of thickness of the tubes of the lower layer and 20 % of the peripheral elbows, geometrical calibration of the tubes (to look for creep), radiography (to look for internal corrosion and the presence of coke),&lt;br&gt;o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; continuous monitoring of the skin temperature of the tubes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the radiation part:&lt;br&gt;o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; checks of thickness on 20% of the tubes and elbows at each annual shut-down (replacement of the reactor catalyst),&lt;br&gt;o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; at the next major shut-down in 2007: measurements of thickness of the tubes and elbows, geometrical calibration of the tubes (to look for creep), metallographic replica tests on tubes at two different heights (to look for sensitization of the stainless steel),&lt;br&gt;o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; continuous monitoring of the skin temperature of the tubes at two heights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The inspections and periodic requalifications will be accompanied by verification of the safety accessories and the requalification of a hydraulic test.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Passivation procedure:&lt;br&gt;An internal working group was set up to re-examine the passivation procedure and the equipment likely to be concerned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Feedback from experience on other equipment or other units:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are no other desulphuration ovens on the site that could display this type of corrosion.&lt;br&gt;According to the operator, the aggression by polythionic acids could also occur on the catalytic reformer, as also in unit HDT2 (hydrogen treatment) where, as a consequence of the geometrical constraints, passivation is not feasible. The DRIRE has nevertheless asked the operator to conduct more intensive investigations of these units to look for the possible&amp;nbsp; presence of this phenomenon of corrosion.&lt;br&gt;Examination of the accident case histories involving ovens in refineries (ARIA database compiled by BARPI) did not identify any similar accident (June 2005).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastUser":{"UserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"Name":["MINERVA"],"Surname":["Administrator"],"IsVisibleSensibleData":[false]},"LastDate":["2017-07-11T15:59:38.73"],"ParentCompany":{},"Region":{},"Province":{},"City":{},"PostCode":{},"Concurrency":[0]},"LockedUserId":{},"LockedDate":{},"IsLocked":[false],"IsLockedByMe":[false],"LockedUser":{}},"AccidentProfile_Tab":{"ReportingAuthority":{},"ContactPerson":{},"Reasons":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Substances involved: greater than 5% of quantity in Column 3 of Annex I"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Injury to persons: &gt;= 1 fatalities, &gt;= 6 hospitalizing injuries etc."},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Immediate damage to the environment (according to Annex VI)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Damage to property: on-site &gt;2M &amp;euro;, off-site &gt; 0.5M &amp;euro;"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"Cross-border damage: transboundary accidents"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"Interesting for lessons learned."}],"AffectedCountries":{}},"AccidentDescription_Tab":{"AccidentDescription":{"DominoEffects":[false],"NatechEvents":[false],"TransboundaryEffects":[false],"Contractors":[false],"accTypeRelease":[0],"accTypeFire":[0],"accTypeExplosion":[0],"accTypeTransport":[0],"accTypeOther":{},"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastDate":["2017-07-11T16:00:08.689"],"Concurrency":[0],"Translation":{"VersionId":["de21c5c5-cfe6-e0de-1200-609baba8142d"],"LanguageId":["EN"],"AccidentDescription":["There was a fire in the pre-heating oven of the gas-oil hydrodesulphuration unit for the of the refinery.\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The accident is classified at level 4 of the accident gravity scale, as officially published in February 1994 by the Comity of Competent Authorities for the implementation of the Seveso Directive (level 3 for the evacuation of 600 persons; level 2 for the quantities of substances released by the accident and level 4 for the resulting costs).\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The accident:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;On 26 June 2004 at 16.38, a fire broke out on oven 42F201. Large flames enveloped the oven (the metal of the convection part became red-hot) and gave off black smoke. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fire does not appear to have been preceded by an explosion, but by a suspicious noise, described by witnesses as a whistling noise (as of a valve) growing more and more intense, and then a \"mechanical\" noise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Staff working on a neighbouring unit quickly released alarm and had already manually activated part of the water curtains by the time the safety teams intervened. The operator then cut off supplies to the unit (load and hydrogen) and started decompression to the flare, which was successful in rapidly reducing the combustion. The structures supporting the oven and subjected to intense heat flow were cooled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The external fire was brought under control in 30 minutes using the onsite emergency response services of the refinery. The external emergency response services dispatched to the scene did not need to intervene. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The combustion of the products from the reactor loop (reactor 42R202) continued at a high level of intensity for several hours in the convection chambers of the oven and the flues at the outlet of the latter.&lt;br&gt;The output of the common chimney collecting the emissions to the atmosphere of the HDS units, atmospheric distillation no. 2 (DA2) and extraction of aromatics (hydrogen treatment section no.&amp;nbsp; 2 - HDT2) was seen to produce flames intermittently for several minutes accompanied by a considerable plume of smoke.&lt;br&gt;None of the detectors of ambient H2S on the unit triggered an alarm.

The reasons given are accidental overheating when restarting in the case of the tube changed in 2001 and zones of overheating due to maladjustment of the burners in 2001 for the 16 tubes. &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;"],"Other":[""]}},"SiteStorageMajors":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"process-associated (stockholding, etc. on-site of manufacture)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"distribution-associated (not on-site of manufacture)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false}],"SiteStorageInitiating":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"process-associated (stockholding, etc. on-site of manufacture)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"distribution-associated (not on-site of manufacture)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false}],"SiteProcessMajors":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"chemical batch reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"chemical continuous reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"electrochemical operation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"physical operations (mixing, melting crystallizing, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"treating/use for treatment (stenching, preserving, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"power generation (burning fuel, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"disposal activities (incinerating, burying, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"heat exchanger (boiler, refrigerator, heating coils, etc.","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false}],"SiteProcessInitiating":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"chemical batch reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"chemical continuous reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"electrochemical operation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"physical operations (mixing, melting crystallizing, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"treating/use for treatment (stenching, preserving, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"power generation (burning fuel, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"disposal activities (incinerating, burying, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"heat exchanger (boiler, refrigerator, heating coils, etc.","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false}],"SiteTransferMajors":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pipeline/pipework transfer","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"mechanical transfer (conveyors, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"vehicular transport","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"loading/unloading activities (transfer interfaces)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false}],"SiteTransferInitiating":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pipeline/pipework transfer","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"mechanical transfer (conveyors, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"vehicular transport","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"loading/unloading activities (transfer interfaces)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false}],"SiteTransportMajors":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"packaging (bagging, cylinder filling, drum filling, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false}],"SiteTransportInitiating":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"packaging (bagging, cylinder filling, drum filling, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false}]},"SubstancesInvolved_Tab":{"SubstancesDescription":{"VersionId":["de21c5c5-cfe6-e0de-1200-609baba8142d"],"Toxic":[0],"Ecotoxic":[0],"Flammable":[0],"Explosive":[0],"Translation":{"VersionId":["de21c5c5-cfe6-e0de-1200-609baba8142d"],"LanguageId":["EN"],"Description":["At this stage the quantities assessed are as follows:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; the quantity of hydrocarbons involved in the fire is of the order of 45 tonnes, which represents the release to the atmosphere of about 1 tonne of SO2 (C.A.S.

The last periodic requalification with testing took place in April 2002, and was successful. It had thus been in service subsequently for 27 months at the time of the fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The HDS unit was inspected at the time of the general shut-down in 2002 (\"metal\" shutdown) and was stopped in 2003 for a simple change of catalyst.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The non-destructive tests performed since the start have consisted in measurement of thickness by ultrasound and dimensional inspections to check the absence of creep, all conducted on the radiation part, as the inspection department held that this was the most vulnerable. Since 1993, metallographic replica tests have been carried out on the radiation tubes and showed the beginnings of sensitization of the stainless steel (beginnings of corrosion which could lead to modification of the mechanical characteristics), but this was judged acceptable by the inspection department, in the absence of loss of cohesion or microfissures.&lt;br&gt;On the convection part, only measurements of thickness of the peripheral elbows were made (see photo below), no anomaly being recorded. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The inspection report of the periodic requalification performed in 2002 shows that, on the convection part, the visual inspection carried out on the lower layer, according to the inspection department, revealed no anomalies. In this connection, the history of the thickness measurements on the radiation tubes and convection elbows since 1993 shows no abnormal reduction of thickness.&lt;br&gt;For obvious design reasons, it is impossible to inspect the interior of the tubes.&lt;br&gt;The periodic requalification was accompanied by a hydraulic test carried out a pressure of 85.5 bars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before the fire, the HDS had been operating since the previous day in \"domestic heating oil\" mode, a rate of operation considered as moderate. It was fed with a mixture of light distillate from vacuum distillation unit no. 2 and LCO (light gas-oil rich in cyclics) from the catalytic cracker unit. The sulphur content of the load was estimated at 1.16%. &lt;br&gt;It should be noted that before being introduced into oven 42F201, this received an addition of hydrogen contributing to the desulphuration reaction. &lt;br&gt;According to the records, the skin temperature of oven 42F201 was stable in the region of 373¬∞C, the maximum permissible temperature being 392¬∞C (set point).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Origin of the fire:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The tubes constituting the lower convection layer were found not to have melted, having seemingly been supplied to the end by the load and thus \"cooled\". Among these, one tube found to have burst (a clean break of 500 mm), has since been thought to have been the origin of the fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Expert examinations performed:&lt;br&gt;Two expert examinations were carried out, one by an external expert, the other by the Group's research centre.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Expert examination by the external expert:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was carried out on 2 tubes (the burst tube and a neighbouring tube) on the basis of a geometrical, fractographic and metallurgical analysis of the burst tube and of mechanical tests and analyses by X-ray diffraction.&lt;br&gt;This revealed that the rupture was caused by four types of deterioration, the effects of which had cumulatively led to a reduction of thickness to a point below that at which the tube could withstand operating pressure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These types of deterioration are as follows:&lt;br&gt;- aggression supposedly due to exposure to polythionic acids: these acids form when the sulphurised constituents of the load are in contact with oxygen. This situation cannot occur in normal operation, as the load contains no oxygen. It is encountered during shutdowns or hydraulic tests. To avoid this phenomenon, a passivation operation is performed during the shutdown process (a procedure formalized since 1985). This aggression is thought to be old, as passivation has been performed since 1980. It results in the localized formation of grooves in the inside of the tubes of the oven.&lt;br&gt;- reduction of thickness by oxidation/sulphuration: in the grooves formed by the polythionic acid aggression, the material (austenitic stainless steel) had lost its unoxidizable character, leading to a reduction of thickness by corrosion.&lt;br&gt;- the presence of sigma phase (an intermetallic compound causing very marked fragility of the metal) in a low proportion, which may have facilitated the development and penetration of the intergranular attack.&lt;br&gt;- loss of intergranular cohesion entailing slow creep which, in its turn, generates fissuring in the outer skin of the tubes: this phenomenon could be explained by poor heat exchange, due to a deposit of coke on the inside of the tube. This external deterioration of the tube was not visible to the naked eye.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Expert examination by the Group's research centre:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This examination conducted on another neighbouring tube revealed none of the characteristic appearance of internal intergranular corrosion found on the burst tube. However, on the outside, loss of cohesion due to creep, and on the inside, the presence of a considerable density of sigma phase were observed. The examination came to the conclusion that there were localized defects..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"Other":[""]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["de21c5c5-cfe6-e0de-1200-609baba8142d"],"Consequence_Description":["Human consequences:&lt;br&gt;Two operators were slightly injured during fire extinguishing operations (falls due to irregularities in the paving of the HDS unit hidden in foam).&lt;br&gt;According to the public emergency reponse services, 600 persons were temporarily evacuated from an urban zone of Feyzin (including the swimming pool and the stadium).
