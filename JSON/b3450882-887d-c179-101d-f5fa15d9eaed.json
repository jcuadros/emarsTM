The underground pipes were feeding eleven tanks in different conditions (empty but not degassified, half empty, full, empty and degassified, empty). Maintenance work started on June 11 (hot work-permit had been ordinarily issued on June 10 and the pipes were empty).  When the fire started, the water emulsion in the tank basins became yellow and ignited resulting in fire. The alarm was sounded and all valves were automatically closed (it required about 14 minutes). Soon after, the power supply was also interrupted. After inspection, all accessible valves were found to be closed and therefore rapid extinguishing of the fire was to be expected. Instead, the phenomenon repeated various times that afternoon and the flames were extinguished by the personnel quickly. There was an unsuccessful attempt to extinguish the fire by covering the inspection pit with sand. The fire escalated but the personnel in collaboration with the fire brigade managed to confine it within the tank dike by applying foam using foam monitors. At about 15:20 an explosion occurred and, even if all people thought it was tank No 76, the explosion was caused by two acetylene bottles used in the maintenance works. Finally, it was found that a valve of tank No 1 (full of gasoline) had been opened (for reasons not clarified) and it was releasing gasoline with a rate of 150 m3/h. The fire was extinguished at 15:40 (about 4.5 hours after it started). To extinguish the fire, about 43,000 litres of foam (from storage depot, local fire brigade, etc.), that is about 717 m3 of water, were used. The whole amount of water used in extinguish the fire and cooling the nearby tanks (about 1,500 m3) was collected and treated according to the degree of pollution established after the analysis for BOD5, COD and hydrocarbons. Monitoring of the underground channels revealed no pollution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;

The firemen were burned due to a gust of wind and for the cylinders' explosion. Outside the establishment two people (a photo reporter and a journalist) were injured but not for the effects of the fire or of the explosion. The photo reporter fell down by a roof and the journalist was injured by a fire fighting piping.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MATERIAL LOSS:&lt;br&gt;Damages of some fire fighting equipment of the fire brigade, destruction of the railways and of three wagons of the SNCF. As far as it concerns the depot:&amp;nbsp; tank No 2 was deformed; tanks No 1 and 3 had traces of burning in the upper side; tank No 76 was damaged at the heat insulator; tanks No 76 and 78 had slight damages at the heat insulator; tank No 93 had traces of burning in the upper side and shows some point of impact due to the fragments of the acetylene cylinders (without perforation).&lt;br&gt;The joints of the pipings placed on the left side were burned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ECOLOGICAL HARM:&lt;br&gt;Soot and particulates were emitted for about 4 hours but no toxic gas emission occurred. Floating barriers have been precautionally employed but the fire water used was collected and treated according to the degree of pollution established after the analysis for BOD5, COD and hydrocarbons. Monitoring of the underground channels revealed no pollution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:&lt;br&gt;The traffic was interrupted.
