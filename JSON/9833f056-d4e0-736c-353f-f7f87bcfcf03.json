Casualties were transported to the hospital for further treatment. The company itself ordered all work in the ceramics and masonry yard to cease. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the time of the accident there were several persons in the neigbourhood.&amp;nbsp; The emergency call was first received by the &lt;br&gt;internal&amp;nbsp; industrial guard office who thereafter called the national emergency center (SOS Alarm). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SOS Alarm interpreted&amp;nbsp; the call as an emission of gas and called out the fire service first.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First aid was performed by workmates. However, the ambulance was in the neigbourhood and arrived on scene in about 15 minutes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One person died and one person was brought to hospital and operated on for serious facial injuries.

They had not informed that the cast compound should not be used in enclosed spaces due to the formation of hydrogen gas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The company had internal regulations concerning \"hot works\" like welding. In this case the regulations were not applicable because of a lack of knowledge that hydrogen gas was formed during the hardening process. When there are special conditions the foreman must perform a risk assessment before welding (or other hot works)&amp;nbsp; and after taking necessary measures give permission to act. In this case there was no special condition as welding is generally permitted in the ceramics and masonry yard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Official Action Taken - legal action:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;On 10th May 2004 the Swedish Work Environment Inspection Authority immediately prohibited further maintenance work with the torpedo car. The terms to remove the prohibition were that the company should &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - carry out an investigation on the causes of the accident ,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - perform a risk assessment and &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - remove the risks &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On 11th May 2004 the Swedish Work Environment Inspection Authority pronounced under penalty of a fine prohibition for the company to go on with repair work with the torpedo cars unless the following terms were fulfilled:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; 1. Risk assessment concerning occupational risks with chemical substances.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; 2. Risk assessment concerning work in a place where there is a risk of an explosive atmosphere.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On 18th May 2004 the Swedish Work Environment Inspection Authority changed the terms of prohibition from the 11th of May. In order to remove the prohibition the new terms were that the torpedo cars should be vented during repair and maintenance work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On 8th June 2004 the company informed the Swedish Work Environment Inspection Authority about a completed risk assessment. As can be seen from the risk assessment the risk of explosive atmospheres in the working place had been removed. The company also informed that it had exchanged the casting compound for the compound they used earlier and not the compound that was involved in the accident. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On 9th June the the Swedish Work Environment Inspection Authority removed the earlier prohibition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Official Action Taken - other action:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The company was reported to be legally prosecuted for the accident but the investigation was removed from the cause list. &lt;br&gt;"],"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["6799492a-0079-4d05-aad1-8f4dce857337"],"LastUser":{"UserId":["6799492a-0079-4d05-aad1-8f4dce857337"],"Name":["Enrico"],"Surname":["GUAGNINI"],"IsVisibleSensibleData":[false]},"LastDate":["2018-11-20T13:28:27.35"],"ParentCompany":{},"Region":{},"Province":{},"City":{},"PostCode":{},"Concurrency":[0]},"LockedUserId":{},"LockedDate":{},"IsLocked":[false],"IsLockedByMe":[false],"LockedUser":{}},"AccidentProfile_Tab":{"ReportingAuthority":{},"ContactPerson":{},"Reasons":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Substances involved: greater than 5% of quantity in Column 3 of Annex I"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Injury to persons: &gt;= 1 fatalities, &gt;= 6 hospitalizing injuries etc."},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Immediate damage to the environment (according to Annex VI)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Damage to property: on-site &gt;2M &amp;euro;, off-site &gt; 0.5M &amp;euro;"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"Cross-border damage: transboundary accidents"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"Interesting for lessons learned."}],"AffectedCountries":{}},"AccidentDescription_Tab":{"AccidentDescription":{"DominoEffects":[false],"NatechEvents":[false],"TransboundaryEffects":[false],"Contractors":[false],"accTypeRelease":[0],"accTypeFire":[0],"accTypeExplosion":[0],"accTypeTransport":[0],"accTypeOther":{},"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["6799492a-0079-4d05-aad1-8f4dce857337"],"LastDate":["2018-11-20T13:28:27.35"],"Concurrency":[0],"Translation":{"VersionId":["67db35cc-f40a-490a-bd43-4e90efc72cca"],"LanguageId":["EN"],"AccidentDescription":["The accident happened when a welding electrode was going to be welded on to a broken bolt in a wooden frame to a mould to allow it to be raised in order to fit a lifting eye so that the mould could be lifted out of the hole in the topside of a torpedo car. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A torpedo car is a long tube dressed with castings and ceramic bricks and is used to transport liquid pig iron from the blast furnace to the steelworks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The torpedo car had just been reconditioned with new castings and bricks (The torpedo car is normally reconditioned twice a year).
