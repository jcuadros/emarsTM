The explosions of tanks No 44 and 45 were followed by the fire of the contained methanol. Tank No 42 was also partially damaged because of the explosion of the adjacent No 43: it was still emitting hexane vapours during the inspection. Probably the explosion was caused by the ignition of a mixture of residual methanol vapours with air formed during the degassing operations of tank No 43 (it was degassed with air in order to recover nonane). When the explosion occurred, five workers were working on degassing operations: after the accident, three dead bodies had been recovered and another worker was missed (his lifeless body was found a few days later). On the basis of the positions in which their bodies were found, they were presumably on top of the tank No 43, near to an open man-hole. The last worker, heavily injured, had been found in the pump-room and was hospitalized. According to Carmagnani's officials the tank's cleaning was considered a routine operation: depending on the substances to remove, water or air were used for cleaning purposes. In case of purging with water, washing water gathered by a draining system was conveyed to a waste-water treatment plant. In case that two incompatible substances had to be loaded subsequently into the same tank, purging with air was used (air was pumped in the vessel through a man-hole and was discharged from other openings). This situation occurred for tank No 43 because methanol residues were considered incompatible with nonane that had to be stored. All purging operations were normally carried out without neither nitrogen protection nor by monitoring the surrounding environment for the presence of flammable gases. No fixed explosimeter or smoke detectors were installed but the operators could make use of portable explosimeters and personal protection devices (breathing apparatuses, filters, masks). The first aid room was equipped with stretches and medical supplies and fire extinguishers were placed as laid down under the Fire Brigade's Regulations.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;
