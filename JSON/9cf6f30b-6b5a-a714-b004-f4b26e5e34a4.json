For clarity, the individual measures are briefly outlined as follows. 1. Segregation of the cooling water and rainwater sewer from roof areas which can be polluted by hazardous substances in the event of a malfunction.\nThe rainwater system of the roof areas of the building affected by the fire no longer drains into the cooling water and rainwater sewer but, by agreement with the water management office, is connected to the plant sewer system.\nSimilar measures for other areas of the industrial park will require a master plan approved by the authorities. 2. Monitoring of the TOC (total organic carbon) level in the cooling water and rainwater sewers.\nFor technical reasons the readings from TOC monitoring in the South section of the cooling water and rainwater sewer are displayed after a time lag of approx. five minutes. This time lag is now offset by having the lower valve located directly ahead of the discharge point into the Alz close at the same time as the upper valve when TOC monitoring gives the signal. Thus, given the flow speed of the water, there is sufficient time to contain any polluted water which has already passed the upper valve by closing the lower valve.\nThe readings from TOC monitoring in the East section of the cooling water and rainwater sewer are also displayed after a time lag of approx. five minutes for technical reasons. It is currently being examined whether additional TOC monitoring can be installed at a point upstream in the system. 3. All-clear for contaminated sewers given by the plant fire service only after analyses have been carried out.\nTo prevent any product residues from being washed into the Alz together with cooling water following firefighting operations, where sewers have been loaded with substances toxic to fish or generally hazardous to the environment, in future they will not be given the all-clear until analysis has shown that no products are present. 4. More specific operating instructions and training of staff in the wastewater treatment plant.\nThe technical and organisational measures taken will be set out in more precisely worded operating instructions for the staff in the wastewater treatment plant. The staff will receive training and instruction twice per year. At the most recent training session it was again pointed out what measures must be taken when certain limit values are reached and in what sequence the valves must be activated in hazardous situations. 5. Shortening the closing time of valves in the cooling water and rainwater sewer.\nThe stretch of sewer which is closed off by the upper valve has a diameter of 1.2 m.\nAt normal water levels only approx. 10 to 15 % of that diameter are needed. The basic position of the valve is now set such that only the diameter actually needed is open. This shortens the closing time of the valve. 6. Review of firefighting water retention system.\nThe plant’s local firefighting water retention system was checked in accordance with the applicable regulations.\nThe central water retention system is state-of-the-art. It was found to meet the requirements of the applicable regulations in full.\nNevertheless further investigations are currently being carried out to technically optimise the installation, in particular as regards substances which are insoluble and lighter than water. 7. Isolating cooling water from products hazardous to the environment.\nIn the plant all points at which substances with a fish toxicity of ? 0.1 mg/l are cooled by water are being converted to isolated (primary/secondary circuit) or circulation cooling. 8. Review of all safety equipment in the plant.\nAll plants in the industrial park will undergo a renewed check and assessment on the basis of the inventory of substances present. The existing safety measures will be reviewed on the basis of the results obtained. If necessary further measures will be laid down. 9. Re-examination of other measuring and monitoring methods.\nIt is being investigated whether cutting-edge metrology exists with which the sampling of flowing cooling water at varying water levels can be improved even further."],"EmergencyResponce_Descr":["Once the environmental impact had become apparent (fish kill in the Alz), all sewer systems in the central water reservoir were immediately diverted. - Plant fire service alerted (7.43 p.m.)\n- Presence of all colleagues checked\n- Plant emergency shut-down procedure activated (7.44 p.m.)\n- Containment of water used to extinguish fire in central water reservoir from 7.56 p.m.\n- Containment of contaminated cooling water from 9.21 a.m. on Wednesday 7 March 2012 Clean-up and repair work Environmental damage: measures agreed in consultation with authorities and fisheries experts."],"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastUser":{"UserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"Name":["MINERVA"],"Surname":["Administrator"],"IsVisibleSensibleData":[false]},"LastDate":["2017-07-11T15:59:38.732"],"ParentCompany":{},"Region":{},"Province":{},"City":{},"PostCode":{},"Concurrency":[0]},"LockedUserId":{},"LockedDate":{},"IsLocked":[false],"IsLockedByMe":[false],"LockedUser":{}},"AccidentProfile_Tab":{"ReportingAuthority":{},"ContactPerson":{},"Reasons":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Substances involved: greater than 5% of quantity in Column 3 of Annex I"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Injury to persons: &gt;= 1 fatalities, &gt;= 6 hospitalizing injuries etc."},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Immediate damage to the environment (according to Annex VI)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Damage to property: on-site &gt;2M &amp;euro;, off-site &gt; 0.5M &amp;euro;"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"Cross-border damage: transboundary accidents"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"Interesting for lessons learned."}],"AffectedCountries":{}},"AccidentDescription_Tab":{"AccidentDescription":{"DominoEffects":[false],"NatechEvents":[false],"TransboundaryEffects":[false],"Contractors":[false],"accTypeRelease":[0],"accTypeFire":[0],"accTypeExplosion":[0],"accTypeTransport":[0],"accTypeOther":{},"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastDate":["2017-07-11T16:00:08.689"],"Concurrency":[0],"Translation":{"VersionId":["c6540e90-e0c8-8c7c-b85f-26c43e10ea89"],"LanguageId":["EN"],"AccidentDescription":["During the night of 6-7 March 2012, a fire in an industrial park, which broke out on the roof of a nitrile-amine plant, led to contamination of the river Alz by the company operating the site. Course of events at nitrile-amine plant:\nA connecting pipe between the filtration unit and fume scrubber, which is intended to relieve the pressure in an empty filtration unit, caused a liquid reaction mixture to enter the fume scrubber. The majority of the reaction mixture which entered the scrubber flowed into the waste water sewer via the overflow in the scrubber and could be contained by the grease trap of the nitrile-amine plant (approximately 4 700 kg). Approximately 1 000 kg* of the reaction mixture went through a vent stack to the roof of the nitrile-amine plant where it caught fire (most likely spontaneous ignition due to copper (Cu) catalyst it contained). During the subsequent firefighting operation, much of the water used to extinguish the fire entered the cooling water and rainwater sewers via the roof drainage. This water was channelled along the sewer into a retention basin of the central water reservoir. Approximately 8 kg of the reaction mixture was discharged into the Alz before the valve to the retention basin was completely closed. After the firefighting operation was complete, approximately 100 kg of additional reaction mixture which had contaminated the sewers was discharged over the course of 9 hours through the cooling water outlet into the Alz. Fish kill was caused along a 14 km stretch of the Alz. Three members of the fire brigade were hurt during the firefighting operation or suffered burns during the subsequent clean-up operation and received outpatient treatment.\nThe member of staff from the nitrile-amine plant who discovered the fire was taken to hospital for precautionary reasons and placed under observation overnight. *The 1 000 kg (approx.) of product/copper catalyst mixture was discharged as follows:\n- Approximately 200 kg was contained in the retention basin,\n- Approximately 108 kg was discharged into water which entered the Alz,\n- The remainder (approximately 692 kg) either combusted or was also discharged into the Alz."],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to

At 19:19 a ball valve between the filter and the central scrubber opens. This ball valve is only needed for the ‘cake discharge’ function and may not be opened in normal operation. The ‘cake discharge’ function is only performed two to three times a year to clean the filter. The production stages in the nitrile-amine plant are controlled automatically in the control room via a process control system (PCS) in ‘step sequences’. Since the ball valve is designed as a closing valve, its basic or safety position is ‘OPEN’ (zero position). At the end of the step sequence ‘cake discharge’ the ball valve is closed again. This position ‘CLOSED’ is maintained by the PCS until the valve is activated again.\nIn September 2011 the PCS was converted to a new program which became operational in October 2011. Between the start-up of the new PCS and the incident on 6 March 2012 the ‘cake discharge’ step sequence was not activated. As a result of the conversion of the PCS the background information for the ball valve (‘CLOSED’) was lost. The result was that, in automatic mode, the ball valve switched to its basic position ‘OPEN’. When the step sequence ‘cloudy run’ is started the PCS checks, among other things, whether the ball valve is closed. Therefore, in order to close the ball valve, when the new PCS started up the operating mode was switched from ‘Automatic’ to ‘Manual’. At the above-mentioned time the operating mode overview which the operator can call up indicated that the ball valve status was ‘NOMINAL = A (AUTOMATIC), ACTUAL = M (MANUAL)’. Instead of a green button as in automatic mode, the operating mode overview showed a red button with the message ‘OK’.\nAlthough the step sequence ‘cloudy run’ had been running without problem since 18:53, the operator switched the ball valve to Automatic and thus opened it. There was no safety check or locking of the ball valve in normal production operation.\nAfter the ball valve opened the control room received various messages about rising pH levels and increasing pressure and temperature.\nWhen the ball valve opened the pressure in the filter fell spontaneously to approx. 1.5 bar. At this pressure level the pressure at the filter in the waste gas scrubber also fell. The substance mixture entered the scrubber infeed (volume 2.5 m³) and filled it.\nThe scrubber infeed is open to the atmosphere, i.e. not under pressure. As a result of the pressure in the filter the scrubber infeed and the attached vent stack were completely filled in the period 19:19 to 19:38. At 19:38 product overflowed from the stack (23.5 m high) onto the roof of the building and then at 19:43 the product mixture ignited. It must be assumed that the substance mixture discharged through the stack (approx. 1 000 kg, part of which burned off) also ran off the tin roof of the plant to the building annexed (gutter, downpipe) and onto the lower-lying flat roof, as the mixture of firefighting water and substances subsequently did during the plant fire service deployment. From there it ran through the rainwater drain pipe into the cooling water and rainwater sewer (InfraServ Gendorf sector).\nThe scrubber infeed has a free overflow into the grease trap. Some of the approx. 4.7 t of the substance mixture ran out of the scrubber infeed through the plant waste water system to the grease trap and was contained there. The grease trap was sealed off at 20:02, so that from that time onwards no more plant waste water entered the central waste water cleaning installation. According to the operating instructions dated 4 November 2011, if product enters the manufacturing waste water sewer the grease trap must be closed immediately. Therefore the substance mixture had already been discharged through this drain before the fluid level in the scrubber had risen so far that the substance mixture could escape through the stack. Even during discharge through the stack, substance mixture continued to flow in the direction of the grease trap along the path described.\nThe substance mixture and the contaminated firefighting water entered the Alz via the cooling water and rainwater sewer. This led to major fish kill and damage to other life in the lower Alz along a stretch of almost 15 kilometres."],"Other":[""]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["c6540e90-e0c8-8c7c-b85f-26c43e10ea89"],"Consequence_Description":["Material damage to plant and building.
