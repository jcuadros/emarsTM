The concentration levels determined during the monitoring ranged 4% to 14% of the lower flammability threshold limit.\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Official action taken - legal action: &lt;br&gt;The General Attorney's Office of Taranto has opened an  information procedure on a non criminal event. The General Attorney has not given not requested an official technical consultancy report.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Official action taken - other official action:&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The company notified the accident in compliance with art 24 leg. Decree N.334/99 (article 14 of the Seveso Directive 96/82/CE) and communicated the contamination occurred in compliance to environmental legislation (legislative decree N. 152/2006);\nand started the official procedures for executing the remediation operations with respect to the contaminated soil in the retention basin.\nAt present  (date of this report) following steps have been concluded:\n- Classification of the contaminated soil in the retention basin \n- Environmental- and Health- Risk Analysis \n- The validation of the Environmental- and Health- Risk Analysis by the environmental Ministry is expected\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discussion about response: &lt;br&gt;Immediate response\nAt the date of  the present report tank T-3002 had still not been inspected internally. Therefore the causes of the tank rupture, localized on the bottom section of the tank shell, cannot be determined.\nConcerning the emergency response operation, both the onsite emergency plan and the offsite emergency plan were triggered permitting to avoid the evolution of the event into a worst case scenario.\n\nLong term response\nThe company reserves the right to make any technical, organisational and management changes once the causes of the tank rupture is clearly established, after an internal inspection of the tank is performed, which at the actual state of the works is foreseen for June 2007.\nMeanwhile the company:\n- did not consider it necessary to change the existing tank inspection and control procedures\n- has confirmed that double bottoms will be installed in the tanks according to the program which started in 2004 and is scheduled to end in 2010 \n- The company has been intensifying the control on the work progress in the tank bottom exchange program such to assure the respect of the timing defined.\n- The company has already started official procedures for organising the remediation operations comprising the opening, inspection, repair end refurbishment of the tank (double bottom), and has started the official procedure foreseen in legislative decree  Dlgs 152/2006 which will conclude with the remediation operations of the contaminated soil in the containment basin.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seveso II Duties- Remarks:&lt;br&gt;The Regional Technical Committee (CTR)&amp;nbsp; has concluded his evaluation of the safety report 2005 in November 2006, prescribing following actions to be taken:&lt;br&gt;- Installation of remote controls on the pumps and of the root valves of category A tanks (for liquids with flash point &amp;lt;21Â°C),&lt;br&gt;- Installation of fixed extinguishing foam sprayers in proximity of containment basins of Category A tanks.&lt;br&gt;- For floating roof tanks installation of redundant breathing valves&lt;br&gt;- Installation of&amp;nbsp; valves at the end of&amp;nbsp; the rainwater drainage pipes in the floating roofs of Category A tanks. &lt;br&gt;The safety report foresaw the catastrophic rupture of a crude oil tank with estimated soil contamination levels&amp;nbsp;

crude oil into the unpaved containment basin.\nThe onsite emergency response plan, specific for the tank storage area, was activated, the other units of the refinery maintained normal operation, because a general emergency had not been declared\nAfter the spilled crude oil  had been completely pumped from the containment basin into neighbouring tanks, soil tests showed soil contamination with an average depth of 30 cm  and a maximum depth of 2 m, with a concentration of contaminants above permitted  threshold values .\nAs precautionary measure the train line Taranto - Bari  passing some 80m from the company's premises was closed until 5:30 on 2/05/2006.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Area concerned - Remarks:&lt;br&gt;The occurrence has involved the tank T_3002 and the containment basin of approx 14.040 m2 surface.&lt;br&gt;The tank is located in a storage park which is physically separated from the refinery's processing installations by the state road SS 106 Jonica.&lt;br&gt;The processing installations were not affected by the occurrence and continued working.&lt;br&gt;The emergency plan specific for the storage, handling and blending department was activated.&lt;br&gt;Soil contamination has affected the area corresponding to the containment basin of tank T-3002.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People - Remarks:&lt;br&gt;The accident has caused no victims.&lt;br&gt;The onsite population considered at risk includes exclusively the personnel of the onsite emergency response team and the personnel present in the specific area during the accident. The personnel present onsite during holydays consists in the average in 40 units.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ecological Harm - Remarks:&lt;br&gt;The release of crude oil inside the containment basin has caused soil contamination in the basin. &lt;br&gt;Sample probes have showed principally concentrations of heavy hydrocarbons (C&amp;gt;12) and to an minor extends concentrations of light hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds (C&amp;lt;12) above the contamination threshold limits. At a maximal depth of 2m.&lt;br&gt;The stratigraphy of the soil in the basin has shown that at approx. 3 m depth starts a clay layer reaching 80 m depth (data extracted from the regional geologic map) which has a low permeability isolating thus the deep water bed from the superficial water bed which starts at 2,5 m from the surface.&lt;br&gt;The piezometric probes have shown pollution levels in the superficial water bed above the threshold values defined by law but, according to the statements of the company, these values have not changed significantly with respect to the values encountered in the soil classification performed in 2004.&lt;br&gt;The results of the soil classification have been used in the Environmental and -Health Risk Analysis which was performed and has shown an unacceptable risk at such concentration level and therefore the need of remediation measures. The company is waiting the validation by the Ministry of Environment&amp;nbsp; of the results obtained in the Risk Analysis such to set up a remediation project. &lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, due to the fact that that part of the contaminants in the contaminated soil are washed out by precipitation and thus reach the water shed, a permanent piezometric monitoring system of the water shed through a series of wells placed hydro-geologically upstream and downstream from the tank T-3002. &lt;br&gt;In any case the watershed&amp;nbsp; Remediation project for the entire refinery which has been authorised in 2004 foresaw the construction of a hydraulic barrier in correspondence of tank T-3002, which has been realised. The hydraulic barrier consists in a series of pozzi di emungimento (injection wells) from which the water from the superficial water shed&amp;nbsp; can be pumped for treatment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Material Loss - Remarks:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;The company had following costs:&lt;br&gt;- Emergency response action (rental of motorised pumps, medium and high expanding&amp;nbsp; foaming agent and other consumables);&lt;br&gt;- Temporary repair of the tank by constructing a retention wall of approx 2 m of steel reinforced concrete in correspondence to the leakage point.&lt;br&gt;- The contaminated soil analysis and the Risk Analysis specific for the occurrence&lt;br&gt;The numbers indicated comprise also the estimated cost for:&lt;br&gt;Tank cleaning, opening, repair and retrofitting (installation of a double bottom)&lt;br&gt;Contaminated soil remediation inside the retention basin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Community Disruption - Remarks:&lt;br&gt;The railway lines Taranto - Bari and Taranto- Metaponto which pass respectively at 80 and 165m from the western limit of the retention basin, were closed down as a precautionary measure &lt;br&gt;The state road S.S 106 Ionica was closed and patrolled by police in the tract adjacent to the tank for a shorter period of time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Affected Area: installation&lt;br&gt;Affected Area: establishment&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Consequences - Ecological harm - pollution/contamination/damage of: &lt;br&gt;
