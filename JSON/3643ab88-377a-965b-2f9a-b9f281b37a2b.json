The installation of barrages enabled smoke emissions from the shafts to be rapidly reduced. Analyses of micro-pollutants, made on samples taken at several places and in particular in the environment (soil and plants), did not reveal any notable impact. The main values exceeding the standards allowed concerned two carcinogen pollutants, benzene and benzo(a)pyrene. Subsequent analyses for those 2 pollutants on smoke captured in block 15 seem to conclude that the emissions were of short duration. Significant quantities of dioxins and furans on the walls of tunnels close to block 15, at a depth of 600 m, but no contamination was found on the surface.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No effects were found on the health of people living near the plant. At the time of the accident, the public were not asked to stay indoors but three nearby schools were closed, as a precaution. However several miners exposed to smoke at the time complained of skin problems and throat irritations. These assessments were confirmed by the panel of experts appointed by the local information and monitoring commission (CLIS) which concluded that there was no particular risk to local people, the public or surface staff and reported that several emergency service crew members showed clinical signs of slight intoxication with carbon monoxide, skin disorders and digestive problems that required medical attention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Initially, the fire caused work to be suspended at the storage centre and adjoining mine: thus 27 storage employees and 350 miners were laid off. Subsequently, it ultimately marked the permanent ending of operation of the centre. The future of the 40,000 t of waste stored down the mine has not yet been decided. Moreover, the ending of potash extraction, which should have been in April 2003, was brought forward by 6 months.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"Human":[0],"Environmental":[0],"Cost":[1],"Disruption":[1]},"HumanOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"HumanOffSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"DetailHumanOffSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Establishment total at risk","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"immediate fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"subsequent fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"hospitalizing injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other serious injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"health monitoring","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true}],"DetailHumanOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Establishment total at risk","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"immediate fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"subsequent fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"hospitalizing injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other serious injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"health monitoring","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true}],"DetailHumanEmergency":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Establishment total at risk","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"immediate fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"subsequent fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"hospitalizing injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other serious injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"health monitoring","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true}],"EnvironmentalOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"inland: metropolitan development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"inland: urban development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"inland: rural development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"inland: parkland/commonland","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"inland: grassland/pasture/meadow","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"inland: arable land/crops/vineyards/orchards","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"inland: woodland;
