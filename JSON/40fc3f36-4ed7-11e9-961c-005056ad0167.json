For some waste streams, rotary furnaces are used. These furnaces can be fed in various ways. One of these ways is from storage tanks. At the time of the accident, these tanks were being filled from tankers. This transfer takes place via a discharge pit.&lt;/p&gt;"],"Installation_Description":["&lt;p&gt;The discharge pits are part of the discharge installation for waste awaiting processing in the storage tanks. The waste is discharged from a tanker into the discharge pit using gravity but under low nitrogen pressure. The discharge pit is a concrete underground tank covered with a concrete lid. This discharge passes through a drum sieve to remove the solid parts from the stream using a screw. The waste stream is pumped from these discharge pits into the tanks in the tank farm. This pumping starts during the discharge from the tanker and stops automatically if the level in the discharge pit is low. The discharge pits are never completely emptied. Calculations show that around 500-700 litres of the previous load remains in the discharge pit. In order to prevent possible ingress of oxygen into the installation, the storage tanks in the tank farm, the discharge pits and the drum sieves are connected to a displacement gas network. Everything in the vapour phase is interconnected via this displacement gas network, which provides a slight excess pressure. This displacement gas network is not intended to be an inertisation system. The displacement gas network operates between 8 mbar and 12 mbar overpressure. At 12 mbar an automatic shut-off valve to the furnace is opened. At that time, the gases are sent to the furnace, where they are incinerated. At 8 mbar the shut-off valve to the furnace is closed again. In order to maintain the pressure in this system, nitrogen is added to the displacement gas system if the pressure drops below 5 mbar. There are three pressure gauges in the displacement gas network. Of these, PT90010 regulates the pressure between 8 mbar and 12 mbar, and PT90009 ensures the minimum pressure of 5 mbar in the displacement gas network. There is also a pressure gauge at the furnace (PT901), but no automatic actions are connected to this.&lt;/p&gt;"],"Other":{}}},"SiteStorageMajors":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"process-associated (stockholding, etc. on-site of manufacture)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"distribution-associated (not on-site of manufacture)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false}],"SiteStorageInitiating":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"process-associated (stockholding, etc. on-site of manufacture)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"distribution-associated (not on-site of manufacture)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false}],"SiteProcessMajors":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"chemical batch reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"chemical continuous reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"electrochemical operation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"physical operations (mixing, melting crystallizing, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"treating/use for treatment (stenching, preserving, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"power generation (burning fuel, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"disposal activities (incinerating, burying, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"heat exchanger (boiler, refrigerator, heating coils, etc.","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false}],"SiteProcessInitiating":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"chemical batch reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"chemical continuous reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"electrochemical operation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"physical operations (mixing, melting crystallizing, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"treating/use for treatment (stenching, preserving, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"power generation (burning fuel, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"disposal activities (incinerating, burying, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"heat exchanger (boiler, refrigerator, heating coils, etc.","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false}],"SiteTransferMajors":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pipeline/pipework transfer","EquipmentType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"mechanical transfer (conveyors, etc.)","EquipmentType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"vehicular transport","EquipmentType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"loading/unloading activities (transfer interfaces)","EquipmentType":{"EqType_ID":3,"Category":"storage","Description":"container; non-pressurised (hopper, tank, drum, bag, etc.)"},"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","EquipmentType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","EquipmentType":{},"IsChecked":false}],"SiteTransferInitiating":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pipeline/pipework transfer","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"mechanical transfer (conveyors, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"vehicular transport","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"loading/unloading activities (transfer interfaces)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false}],"SiteTransportMajors":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"packaging (bagging, cylinder filling, drum filling, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false}],"SiteTransportInitiating":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"packaging (bagging, cylinder filling, drum filling, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false}]},"SubstancesInvolved_Tab":{"SubstancesDescription":{"VersionId":["e997d840-eab8-435d-b279-98aaba6bd5cc"],"Toxic":[0],"Ecotoxic":[0],"Flammable":[0],"Explosive":[0],"Translation":{"VersionId":["e997d840-eab8-435d-b279-98aaba6bd5cc"],"LanguageId":["EN"],"Description":["&lt;p&gt;An explosion occurred during the accident. Before an explosion can occur, there must be ‘fuel’, oxygen and a source of ignition. Given the characteristics of the waste streams, it can be considered that ‘fuel’ was present. Further investigation showed that a two-step redox reaction between succinonitrile and hydrogen peroxide led to oxygen being formed. Laboratory examination has shown that, for this reaction to occur, rapid mixing must take place and the environment must be basic. All these aspects were present at the time of the accident. The previous discharge into the discharge pit was a mixture in which a succinonitrile compound was present. The pH of this mixture is 9, meaning that the environment was basic. The tanker that was being unloaded at the time of the explosion contained various IBCs with different waste liquids. Two of these IBCs contained peroxides. These peroxides accumulated in the lowest aqueous layer in the tanker. A difference in densities of the products of the IBCs had led to the formation of two layers (oil above an aqueous layer) in the tanker. The content of the IBCs concerned was in the aqueous layer that was discharged first given that the tanker is unloaded from the bottom. The speed of the discharge from the tanker led to a sufficiently rapid mixing in the discharge pit to allow the reaction to occur. Further analysis of this reaction showed that 20-30&amp;nbsp;m³ of oxygen was formed during this reaction. This explains the formation of the explosive atmosphere in the discharge pit and the displacement gas network.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The IBCs with the product containing hydrogen peroxide contained only a limited amount of hydrogen peroxide and were not classified as a hazardous substance.&lt;/p&gt;"],"Other":{}}},"SubstanceClassification":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"01.

The investigation into possible ignition sources shows that there are three possible scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;— Ignition source in the discharge pit&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;— Ignition source in the vicinity of the discharge pit&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;— Ignition from the furnace&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The various scenarios and their likelihood are briefly explained below.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ignition source within the discharge pit. &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Gases having a self-ignition temperature of around 200 °C were present in the discharge pit. &amp;nbsp;However, the self-ignition temperature lowers in an oxygen rich environment. &amp;nbsp;Assuming a halving then the self-ignition temperature may have been lowered to 100 °C. &amp;nbsp;However, the temperature switch present in the discharge pit, was not activated before the explosion, which implies that the temperature in the discharge pit remained below its setpoint of 90 °C. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Due to the oxygen formation, foam was generated in the discharge pit, which could have led to an electrostatic discharge. Due to the higher oxygen concentration in the discharge pit, also the ignition energy of the products is lowered. &amp;nbsp;If this is being considered a possible source of ignition, it remains unclear why the explosion occurred 10 minutes after the discharge started, while after 3 minutes the oxygen concentration already represented more than 50% in the discharge pit. &amp;nbsp;Furthermore, the foam is formed by a product with good conductivity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This scenario is considered unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ignition source nearby the discharge pit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hereby the possibility is investigated that the explosive mixture ignited outside the discharge pit. It should be noted that the zone surrounding the discharge pit is classified as zone 2, which implies that the installations present therein, do not constitute an ignition source during normal operation. &amp;nbsp;From the pressure measurements, it appears that the pressure in the displacement gas network remained below 16 mbar. &amp;nbsp;This pressure is too low to open the pressure relief valve on the discharge pit. The pressure relief valve is set to 18 mbar. &amp;nbsp;At some point, a pressure decrease is observed, but this is too slow to be due to the venting of the pressure relief valve. &amp;nbsp;The pressure profile of the pressure reduction, with a pressure decrease which is slower at the beginning than at the end, also does not indicate the venting of a pressure relief valve. &amp;nbsp;On the other hand, one can think that a pressure increase in the displacement gas network has caused one rusted section of the pipework to fail. &amp;nbsp;After the explosion indeed, at some places in the displacement gas network holes were found in the pipes. Further metallurgical investigation showed that the piping still had a sufficient thickness to resist against the pressure increase before the explosion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This scenario is considered unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ignition from the furnace&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The pipeline to the furnace, during the minutes before the explosion, was filled with a mixture that systematically has become richer in oxygen. &amp;nbsp;In addition, at the time of the accident also a discharge was ongoing on discharge pit South. While pumping from the discharge pit into tank V11010, &amp;nbsp;vapours from this tank, containing toluene vapours were pushed in the pipelines of the displacement gas network. &amp;nbsp;As this is the same pipeline, it is certainly possible to have formed a flammable mixture. &amp;nbsp;This mixture could have been ignited in the furnace, so it is possible that the flame ran against the flow back. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;However, the flame arrestor, present in this pipe should have ensured that the flame was stopped. &amp;nbsp;According to the company, there are two scenarios that can explain why the flame arrestor may not have worked:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul style=\"list-style-type: disc\"&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Such flame arrestor may fail when the oxygen concentration is higher than 40%. &amp;nbsp;Higher oxygen concentration will increase the flame speed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A flame arrestor ensures that the hot combustion gases cool down within the fine mesh of the flame arrestor. &amp;nbsp;If this occurs several times then the flame arrestor can become too warm to function properly&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When the flame has passed the flame arrestor it can further propagate towards tanks and discharge pits. &amp;nbsp;Because of the high oxygen concentration, the flame speed can reach more than 100 m/s, and will travel in a short time to the intersection of the pipelines to the tanks and the pipelines to the discharge pits. &amp;nbsp;In the pipelines to the tanks, the flame will extinguish due to lack of oxygen. &amp;nbsp;The concentration of oxygen that has flowed previously from the discharge pit North towards the tanks is rather limited.&amp;nbsp; The flame will propagate further towards the discharge pits. &amp;nbsp;Here is a higher oxygen concentration and probably sufficient combustible gases. &amp;nbsp;Due to the increased oxygen concentration, the flame propagation will be very fast.&amp;nbsp; In the pipeline to the discharge pit South, the flame will extinguish due to a lack of oxygen (analogous reasoning as for the tanks), but in the discharge pit North, on the contrary the flame can cause an explosion.&amp;nbsp; The rise to 3 mbar at the level of PT901 (furnace), about 10 s before the explosion which can be caused by a first ignition in the displacement gas network line, stopped by the flame arrestor. Also consistent with an ignition from the furnace is that pressure gauge PT90009 which is the furthest from the furnace in the lines, doesn’t show the same pressure increase as the other pressure gauges during the explosion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So ignition from the furnace is considered the most likely ignition source.&lt;/p&gt;"],"Other":{}}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","CauseType":{"Type_ID":1,"Category":"all","Description":"none"},"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["e997d840-eab8-435d-b279-98aaba6bd5cc"],"Consequence_Description":["&lt;p&gt;The explosion destroyed the discharge pit and caused enormous damage to the transfer station.
