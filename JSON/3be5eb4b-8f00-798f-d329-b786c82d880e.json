Generally, the pipe-line is permanently filled with light fuel oil between two transfer phases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pipes are made out of 5,56 mm thick steel and have an internal section of 100 mm, the pipe-line is 7430 m long and is made of 12 m elements which are welded together at their ends. The pipe is covered with a 3 mm resin sleeve glued on the metal, a 5 cm insulation layer of polyurethane and finally another sleeve identical to the first one&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The operating pressures are 40 bar for normal operation and 90 bar for forced operation in case of cooling of heavy fuel oil during decanting. The pipeline has been tested with 102 bar when it was put into service and during inspections every ten years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The transfer procedure from the intermediate storage facility to the power station is the following one:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- pumping of light fuel-oil for 4 hours at 70° C and 10 bar in order to heat the pipe walls and avoid incrustations;&lt;br&gt;- pumping of the heavy fuel oil heated to 85° C with a starting pressure of 40 bar, the pressure drops to 36 bar during&amp;nbsp; transfer operation when the pipe walls reach steady state temperature- &lt;br&gt;- pumping of \"cold\" light fuel oil at 20 bar to rinse the pipeline. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- filling of the pipeline with light fuel oil without any pressure between two transfer operations; in fact the pressure in the pipeline section towards the coast ( where the accident occurred) is&amp;nbsp; approximately 2 bar. This static pressure is due to the level difference between the location of the power station and the coast (pressure column).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The transfer operations are performed by the personnel of the storage installation located near the intermediate storage facility which by contract is operated by the same personnel. When the storage facility is filled the power station has between 20 and 45 days of production supply depending on energy requests. &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;"],"Other":[""]}},"SiteStorageMajors":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"process-associated (stockholding, etc. on-site of manufacture)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"distribution-associated (not on-site of manufacture)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false}],"SiteStorageInitiating":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"process-associated (stockholding, etc. on-site of manufacture)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"distribution-associated (not on-site of manufacture)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false}],"SiteProcessMajors":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"chemical batch reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"chemical continuous reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"electrochemical operation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"physical operations (mixing, melting crystallizing, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"treating/use for treatment (stenching, preserving, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"power generation (burning fuel, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"disposal activities (incinerating, burying, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"heat exchanger (boiler, refrigerator, heating coils, etc.","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false}],"SiteProcessInitiating":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"chemical batch reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"chemical continuous reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"electrochemical operation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"physical operations (mixing, melting crystallizing, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"treating/use for treatment (stenching, preserving, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"power generation (burning fuel, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"disposal activities (incinerating, burying, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"heat exchanger (boiler, refrigerator, heating coils, etc.","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false}],"SiteTransferMajors":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pipeline/pipework transfer","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"mechanical transfer (conveyors, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"vehicular transport","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"loading/unloading activities (transfer interfaces)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false}],"SiteTransferInitiating":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pipeline/pipework transfer","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"mechanical transfer (conveyors, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"vehicular transport","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"loading/unloading activities (transfer interfaces)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false}],"SiteTransportMajors":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"packaging (bagging, cylinder filling, drum filling, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false}],"SiteTransportInitiating":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"packaging (bagging, cylinder filling, drum filling, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false}]},"SubstancesInvolved_Tab":{"SubstancesDescription":{"VersionId":["799ff9d4-c48b-e680-808c-9417b471cc6b"],"Toxic":[0],"Ecotoxic":[0],"Flammable":[0],"Explosive":[0],"Translation":{"VersionId":["799ff9d4-c48b-e680-808c-9417b471cc6b"],"LanguageId":["EN"],"Description":["&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The pipe-line was transferring heavy fuel oil when the accident happened&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"Other":["No"]}},"SubstanceClassification":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"01.

Several corrosion craters were also found outside the area around the piercing point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand the presence of oxides on the external wall of the pipe and on the ripped borders makes it plausible that the leakage was not recent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tests with an electronic micro-analyser probe on the oxides found externally to the pipe-line wall showed the presence of chlorides.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These investigations led the operator to the following conclusions:&lt;br&gt;- the piercing of the pipe-wall was due to a significant loss of thickness of the pipe-walls;&lt;br&gt;- the generalised external corrosion of corresponding pipe-section was caused by chlorides; &lt;br&gt;- brackish water was present because of changes in the watershed-level and contamination of the water shed with sea water; &lt;br&gt;- and finally a localised failure of the pipe-protection &lt;br&gt;were the originating causes of the occurrence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The assumption of the contamination of the watershed with sea-water was confirmed by the institution of hydro-geological experts of the Department of southern Corsica. Changes of the water-shed level were significant, rising several metres over a few days up to&amp;nbsp; above ground level. &lt;br&gt;"],"Other":[""]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["799ff9d4-c48b-e680-808c-9417b471cc6b"],"Consequence_Description":["The investigations performed by the operator have shown&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp; soil pollution of the superficial earth layers with heavy fuel oil &lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp; soil pollution with light fuel oil&amp;nbsp; limited to the sandy areas of the underground, this kind of pollution was contained within the sandy layers by the presence of a considerable amount of compact turf&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp; pollution of the underground watershed localised to a limited area but potentially migrating at an unknown speed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The amount of light fuel oil which infiltrated underground was estimated by the operator at 400 m3 to which the already recovered amount&amp;nbsp; (250 m3) has to be added.
