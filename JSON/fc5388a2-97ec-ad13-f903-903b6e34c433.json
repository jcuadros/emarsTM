The substances involved in the accident, according to the information so far retrieved, are primarily bitumen and secondarily heavy distillates of refinery (vacuum distilled, named hot-oil), present in a closed loop and used in the reservoir identified as the accident source, as well as in other equipment as heating fluid; as in Directive 96/82/CE bitumen is not classified as a dangerous substance and therefore removed from its field of application, while the vacuum distillate is classified as dangerous substance for the environment with phrases risk R51/53. The most meaningful damage occurred has been concerning the human health, because of the involvement of some tanker drivers in the fire of the hot oil or due to contact with the 170°C hot bitumen; a spreading of bitumen has also been found in the sea water, whose amount ranges from 6 to 30 m3 according to the estimates of the theoretical spread quantity done by the ARPAM, regional Agency for the environmental protection, through a partially buried ditch present in the area of the Refinery affected by the event.The event occurred on the day September 8th 2004 is therefore qualified as a major accident, having a dangerous substance (hot oil) been involved in quantities above the limits established by the Annex VI and having been damages for the human health following fire or contact with high temperature products with one casualty."],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;

The substances involved in the accident, based on the information up to this moment retrieved, are mainly bitumen and secondarily heavy refinery distillates (vacuum distilled named hot-oil); according to the Directive 96/82/CE bitumen is not classified as dangerous substance and therefore not included in the directive, while the vacuum distillate is classified as dangerous substance for the environment with risk phrases R51/53.The most meaningful damage occurred has been concerning the human health, because of the involvement of some truck drivers in the fire of the hot oil or due to contact with the 170°C hot bitumen; a spreading of bitumen has also been found in the sea water, through a partially buried ditch present in the area of the Refinery affected by the event.The event occurred on the day September 8th 2004 is therefore qualified as a major accident, having a dangerous substance (hot oil) been involved in quantities above the limits established by the Annex VI and having been damages for the human health following fire or contact with high temperature products with one casualty. The event caused the release of both around 592m3, corresponding to around 550t of bitumen (substance not classified as dangerous), and around 150m3 of hot oil (heavy distillate) corresponding to around 120t (substance classified as dangerous for the environment with risk phrases R51/53); this is believed to be the source of fire.

Both scenarios can be brought back to either instrumental or equipment breakdowns or to human error/action. Particularly it is believed as possible by the operations management the introduction of light mixtures or water through the bitumen overload unloading system of the tankers, used for the reintroduction in the reservoir of an eventual excess of bitumen loaded by the tankers to the platforms. The initiation causes are still under characterization; based on the technical elements so far collected by the firm, the overpressure that has lead to the explosion and the projection of the TK-145 bitumen reservoir may have been triggered by the inlet of water, with consequent rapid phase transition to the 170°C hot temperature of the bitumen reservoir, higher than the boiling temperature, or by the introduction of light compounds with formation of an explosive mixture and blast, originated by the bitumen overload unloading system of the tankers; the validity of such an hypothesis depends upon the results of summarizing all the operations performed in the morning of the accident.

People - Remarks: Four drivers present in the bitumen loading area had been involved in the event: 1 was run over by the bitumen and pushed inside a containment basin, where the body was recovered 3 hours after the fire had been extinguished. Three more drivers reported different levels of injures due to the contact with the hot bitumen; two had been hospitalized in hospital and one more had been released from hospital after medication. Ecological Harm - Remarks: The bitumen search and collection operations in the seabed are in progress, being performed by the ICRAM (Institute Central scientific and technological Search Applied to the Sea), as well as the performance, made by the health Authorities, of specific analysis on the seaclams destined to human feeding. According to an initial rough estimation, the costs pointed out by the firm are quantified as follows: - structural loss: three millions euros (residual value of the equipment and destroyed structures) - costs for the emergency half a million euros - costs of pollution recovery operations three millions euros - cost for the renovation and modernization plant 31 millions of euros The amount of 25 millions euros must be added to the above mentioned costs; it is related to one year (time foreseen to re-establish bitumen production operations) missed production.
