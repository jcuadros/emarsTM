On March 27th, the decision was taken to shutdown the distillation train to clean the HCN polymers that had formed.&lt;br&gt;The shut-down procedure foresaw:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- draining the HCN from the train, up to 2% HCN in the drainage water, by directing it toward the ADN unit,&lt;br&gt;- performing air stripping until an HCN concentration is reached which allows the equipment to be opened, the residual gases being burned in the CNIM boiler.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On March 28 and 29, the distillation train was drained (shut-down of the HCN converters, as well as the natural gas heaters and the upstream TGN). Draining remained difficult due to extraction problems at the base of tower H2243. On March 29th at 13:00, the decision was taken to switch over to the air stripping phase.&lt;br&gt;The concentration of 1.2% HCN in the towers, measured at the base of tower H2242, was higher than the usual values although it was below the threshold value of 5% tolerated during the operating mode.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In compliance with the safety procedures, the workshop was evacuated on March 29th at 16:15 p.m. before the stripping operation was launched. &lt;br&gt;The order to evacuate was cancelled 15 minutes later and 9 people returned to the workshop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The explosion occurred at 16:40 at the level of the mist separator H1191 located at 5 m height on the gas line.&lt;br&gt;The two nearest analysers (Toxguard) located at a distance of 10 and 15 m indicated 30 ppm of HCN; the concentration values dropped after 5 minutes. Other equipment located 100 m from the unit sporadically detected values in the order of 4 to 5 ppm of HCN.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The shop personnel were evacuated to a withdrawal zone and the stripping operation was shut down immediately. At 16:45 the unit's Toxguard detector detected a HCN concentration higher than 5 ppm and triggered alarm, the 300 people present in the establishment were ordered to shelter. The on-site emergency plan was put into operation at the same time and the on-site fire-brigade intervened with SCBA (self contained breathing apparatus). Water curtains were set up around the installations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;HCN concentrations measured outside the workshop were below 2ppm.&lt;br&gt;The header line of the HCN absorption tower was isolated from tower H2241 at 17:30.

Its potential causes were examined&amp;nbsp; using the failure tree method. A safe-T-tree was then constructed after having eliminated the highly improbable potential causes: a flashback produced from the boiler was stopped by the separator tank (H1191).&lt;br&gt;According to the operator, the accident was caused by:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- the presence of polymers in the tower which slowed down the drainage of HCN,&amp;nbsp; - at the start of the air stripping phase, an operation conducted with an HCN content higher than normal in the residual gases, the normal drainage of the trains not having been conducted,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; - the presence of several inconsistencies in the implementation procedure:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- since 1989, the stripping procedure has consisted of a blocking phase based on a safety threshold level set at 5% HCN in liquid phase. This threshold is erroneous, stripping at 10°C with an HCN concentration &amp;gt; 1.2% in the liquid leading the lower explosive limit (LEL = 6%) of the hydrocyanic acid in gas phase to be reached. At the time of the accident, the HCN concentration of the liquid at the base of tower H2242 was 1.2%, compatible with the threshold.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- the sample of liquid analysed at the base of tower H2242, containing 1.2% HCN, was not representative of the real HCN amount of the train.&lt;br&gt;A posteriori, the average concentration of the amount analysed was 2%.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- the gas phase HCN analyser present at the tower head was not adapted and did not allow the operators to be alerted. The device was limited to \"normal\" operating ranges: alarm at 0.9% and no measurement beyond 1.2%.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- the operating mode did not explicitly indicate the action to be taken for a concentration&lt;br&gt;greater than 0.9%.&lt;br&gt;By reducing the air outputs, the operators:&lt;br&gt;- reduced the speed of the gases in the line toward the boiler,&lt;br&gt;- promoted flashback,&lt;br&gt;- increased the HCN content in the air and the risk of exceeding the L.E.L.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"Other":["Yes"]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment
