The reaction was recognised to be exothermic; therefore, hydrogen peroxide was added at controlled rates. On the morning of the accident, the chemical operator added the pyridine compound, the catalyst and a peroxide plug (12% of total to be added). The plug was added quickly to the reactor by opening valves 4 and 5 on the by-pass transfer line. For \nfurther peroxide addition, valves 4 and 5 had to be closed and valves 1, 2 and 3 and flow meter F1 opened. The flow meter controlled the rate of peroxide addition at 4.5 kg per minute. A few minutes after the peroxide addition had commenced, the operator in the control room observed the reaction temperature to increase suddenly. Although the quench tank was automatically activated, an explosion occurred a short time later and the whole reactor contents was released. Most of the contents was emitted into the process area through the reactor man-hole cover, which was covered with an aluminium foil disc which would burst at 0.14 bar. The remaining contents was released to the atmosphere through the pressure relief line. As no operators were working in the process area when the accident occurred, no one was injured but 3 construction people working 30 metres away were showered by a fine spray mist. They were quickly drenched under an emergency shower and suffered no side-effects. No plants were damaged in the accident.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The oxidation reactor was located in a process room dedicated to the synthesis of 2-chloropyridine with 70% hydrogen peroxide using a maleic anhydride catalyst to form a pyridine-N-oxide.&amp;nbsp; The reaction was recognized to be exothermic. It was controlled by the rate of addition of the peroxide to a well stirred mixture of the catalyst in pyridine compound. The required peroxide for each batch was transferred from bulk storage to an intermediate holding tank. This tank was located on the ground floor process area and the peroxide was pumped into the reactor via a flow meter. The pyridine was pumped into the reactor from 200 litres drums. The catalyst was added from 50 kg bags through the man-hole. The safety features for this exothermic reaction included: circulation of the reactor contents through two heat exchangers during oxidation; a 200 cm pressure relief line to atmosphere with a 0.7 bar bursting disc; a water quench tank located 3 metres above the reactor, which would automatically dump its contents into the reactor should a sudden temperature increase (&amp;gt; 3Â°C) occur. The peroxide addition pump would not operate if: the quench tank was not full; the circulation pump was not operating; the reactor's vent was not open to the atmopshere. On the morning of the accident, the chemical operator added the pyridine compound, the catalyst and a peroxide slug (12% of total to be added). The plug was added quickly to the reactor by opening valves 4 and 5 on the by-pass transfer line. For further peroxide addition, valves 4 and 5 had to be closed and valves 1, 2 and 3 and flow meter F1 opened. The flow meter controlled the rate of peroxide addition at 4.5 kg per minute. A few minutes after the peroxide addition had commenced, the operator in the control room observed the reaction temperature to increase suddenly and resulted in a runaway reaction. Although the quench tank was automatically activated, an explosion occurred a short time later and the whole reactor contents was released. Most of the contents was released into the process area through the reactor man-hole cover, which was covered with an aluminium foil disc which would burst at 0.14 bar.

As no operators were working in the process area, no one was injured but 3 construction people working 30 metres away were showered by a fine spray mist. They were quickly drenched under an emergency shower and suffered no side-effects. No plants were damaged in the accident. The investigations carried out by the company after the accident showed that approximately 115 Kg of peroxide were added to the reactor over a 3 minutes period instead of the normal 4.5 kg/minute. The subsequent company investigations found valves 4 and 5 closed on the peroxide transfer line and valves 1, 2 and 3 opened just after the accident. For the above accelerated rate of peroxide addition, valves 4 and 5 must have been opened. It is thought that an operator failed to close the valves 4 and 5 and opened valves 1, 2 and 3 following the operating instructions. Just after the explosion, he must have realised his mistake and reset the valves in accordance with the correct instructions before the accident investigations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;

The subsequent company investigations found valves 4 and 5 closed on the peroxide transfer line and valves 1, 2 and 3 opened just after the accident. For the above accelerated rate of peroxide addition, valves 4 and 5 must have been opened. It is thought that an operator failed to close valves 4 and 5 and opened valves 1, 2 and 3 following the operating instructions. Just after the accident, he must have realised his mistake and reset the valves in accordance with the correct instructions before the accident investigations. The accelerated rate of peroxide addition resulted in an exothermic runway reaction. Besides, the process analysis and the design plant were not adequate.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The explosion was caused by a runaway reaction (code 5106) that occurred because of an addition rate of hydrogen peroxide higher than that expected. It was caused by an operator error (code 5401) in following the operating procedures.
