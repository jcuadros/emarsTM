Initially, a strong whistle from this tank had been noticed but it was supposed to be a steam leak. Repair of the steam duct had been organized. The operators sent on the top of the tank for the repair works noticed a cloud with a yellow-green colour escaping from the tank and gave the alarm. A large fire developped and a strong explosion occurred 6 or 7 minutes after the whistle was noticed. Combustion products of cyclohexanone and dimethoate together with the toxic substances from the insulating and plastic materials of the nearby pipings, structures and plants involved in the fire were released into the environment. Due to the explosion, the front bottom part of the tank was thrown towards the Rogor plant and the remaining part, as a missile, against the reinforced concrete wall of the control room about 45 m away. The fire that followed the explosion had been extinguished by water-sprays in about 20 minutes with the intervention of the plant firemen and the National Fire Brigade. Although most of the water used in fire fighting operations had been contained within the tanks dikes (after the interception of the sewer network and by means of dedicated pumps), a certain part of it flowed into the nearby Lavello channel and then in the sea.

The following three days (July 20) others 40 people were hospitalized for 1 or 2 days. 56 people with gas intoxication symptoms were instead carried out to the Carrara's Hospital and 3 of them were hospitalized. Blood samples had been taken from people directly involved in the accident (FARMOPLANT personnel and fire fighters), but the analysis did not detected anything abnormal.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;MATERIAL LOSS:&lt;br&gt;The explosion projected the tank towards the plant for the formulation of liquid pesticides as far as the reinforced concrete wall of the nearby control room, which resulted seriously damaged. No data are available about the cost of these damages. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ECOLOGICAL HARM and COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:&lt;br&gt;Although most of the water used in fire fighting operations had been contained within the tanks dikes (after the interception of the sewer network and by means of dedicated pumps),&amp;nbsp; a certain part of it flowed into the nearby Lavello channel and then in the Tirreneam sea. Prohibition of bathing followed. People was warned to careful wash fruits and vegetables before to eat them and to follow the normal rules of personal hygiene.&lt;br&gt;The degree of pollution of the air, soil and water due to the release of toxic substances and combustion products as well as the fire extinguishing water were continuously controlled (the results of these checks are shown in a document attached to the Original Report). People was warned to careful wash fruits and vegetables before to eat them and to follow the normal rules of personal hygiene.&lt;br&gt;When the Original Report was prepared (27/08/1988) the type of danger was still present because traces of Rogor have been found in some samples taken in the discharge water from FARMOPLANT and in the Lavello torrent.
