It has been tested since early 2003. This procedure includes in particular a rating of the incident established by means of a table covering the nature of the chemical (toxic, flammable, #), the size of the leak, the impact on the site and off the site. A separate rating assesses the potential impact on the basis of the volume of the system (potential leakage), the controllability of the event, the operability of safety systems, the potential impact on the site and off the site, quantifying damage and business interruption. The information is sent to national authorities (CODIS, Prefecture, Police, DRIRE, labour inspectorate, CRAM, emergency services) and to local authorities. The application of this procedure resulted in the company reporting 16 incidents between January and November 2003.&lt;br&gt;The Chalampé chemicals plant has become the pilot site in the company's group for information for the authorities. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The leak revealed:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- technical malfunctions: failure of the steam heating system, absence of information in real time (materials assessment) and alarm enabling the leak to be detected;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- the absence of inspection programmes covering the equipment involved (branch pipes, steam heating system, #) and the actual appointment of people responsible for the inspections;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- the absence of suitable instructions in the event of a leak;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- communication problems between the three departments involved;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- the presence of an unused, large dimension branch pipe without retention because the DN50 mm branch pipe admission valve is kept open;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- inappropriate reactions by operatives due to the aforementioned technical and organisational shortcomings and the absence of diagnostic support systems in the event of an alarm going off;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- incomplete information on the incident.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The leak enabled:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- the effectiveness of the hydraulic barrier to be confirmed (set up in the nineteen eighties following pollution of communes' potable water sources due to the chemicals plant);&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- action programmes to be upgraded and launched to prevent a further substantial leak;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- information to the authorities and adjoining communes to be rethought;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- the plant to be reminded of its duty of care and of the control of processes and the risks presented by its facilities;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- expertise and experience to be quickly assembled in the various departments tasked with public health, protection of the environment, the water authority and classified facilities authority through the workgroup.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"EmergencyResponce_Descr":["When the leak was discovered, the valve at the start of the DN50 mm branch pipe was closed, immediately stopping the leak. The supply to the Olone unit returned to normal. An existing borehole, 30 m from the leak (bore n° 23), was put into operation in order to create an exhaust cone (flow = 900 m//h). The existing hydraulic barrier (network of 25 bore holes distributed around the chemicals plant creating a negative pressure of about 2 m aimed at preventing any downstream migration of pollution in the water table) was adapted so as to guarantee confinement of the pollution within the industrial site. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the end of August 2003, the situation on work undertaken was as follows:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- 55 observation wells (diameter 115 mm) were bored at the site to ascertain the extent of the pollution, pump the floating cyclohexane, vent gas and conduct analyses. This work required special precautions to be taken to prevent any risk of explosion when drilling;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- 2 bore holes to secure the cyclohexane were drilled with lowering of the water table (diameter 300 mm);&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- 1 sparging barrier 300 m long was set up at the northern limit of the site to reinforce the existing hydraulic barrier (injection of air into the water table and recovery of gas by 18 doubled bore holes);&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- 4 observation wells were drilled downstream of the site (in addition to the 3 existing);&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- several hundred cyclohexane analyses were conducted in the observation wells (on site and downstream) by an external laboratory (detection limit 5 µg/l for a potability limit of 10 µg/l). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This work enabled the extent of the pollution to be limited. At the end of August 2003 the spill extended beneath the industrial site over an area 600 m long and 300 m wide. The thickness of the floating cyclohexane varied from a few centimetres to a dozen centimetres. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the end of August 2003, 480 t of cyclohexane had been extracted from the subsoil (more than 90 % of it in floating form), by means of the 3 recovery systems in place: skimming the floating layer, venting and sparging. Investigations were conducted on biological treatment of the pollution using bacteria, specifically to denature cyclohexane, detected at the periphery of the polluted area. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The authorities acted as follows: &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Monitoring and ascertaining the facts,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- conducting 5 inspections, on 8 January, 7 March, 13 June, 2 and 3 July 2003;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- proposing 2 emergency orders by the Prefect on 9 January 2003 (circumstances of the leak, pollution control, surveillance, feedback, information for the authorities) and 12 March 2003 (boosting pumping, downstream surveillance, independent expert assessment);&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- organising 7 meetings with the operator (including 3 on information for the authorities);&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- compiling several dozen reports, statements and letters to the Prefect and the operator as well as to elected representatives, environmental protection associations, the courts and media.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A workgroup made up of the DRIRE, DDASS, DDAF and DIREN was specially formed to monitor and assess the consequences of the leak and suggest to the Prefect any necessary protective measures to be imposed relative to safety and public health. The workgroup concentrated mainly on:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- the operator checking the effectiveness of the hydraulic barrier in place, so as to contain the pollution within the industrial site and prevent any downstream contamination;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- recovering the cyclohexane;&lt;br&gt;- monitoring the water table downstream of the chemicals plant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastUser":{"UserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"Name":["MINERVA"],"Surname":["Administrator"],"IsVisibleSensibleData":[false]},"LastDate":["2017-07-11T15:59:38.73"],"ParentCompany":{},"Region":{},"Province":{},"City":{},"PostCode":{},"Concurrency":[0]},"LockedUserId":{},"LockedDate":{},"IsLocked":[false],"IsLockedByMe":[false],"LockedUser":{}},"AccidentProfile_Tab":{"ReportingAuthority":{},"ContactPerson":{},"Reasons":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Substances involved: greater than 5% of quantity in Column 3 of Annex I"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Injury to persons: &gt;= 1 fatalities, &gt;= 6 hospitalizing injuries etc."},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Immediate damage to the environment (according to Annex VI)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Damage to property: on-site &gt;2M &amp;euro;, off-site &gt;

It no longer maintains the cyclohexane in\nliquid form.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn early December 2002, a cold snap caused the cyclohexane to solidify\nin the branch pipe. The temperature varied greatly over the weekend of\n15-16 December, and the resulting expansion and contraction of the\ncyclohexane caused the branch pipe to rupture at the expansion loop\n(hole about the size of the palm of a hand), being the part most\nexposed to the changes in temperature because of its shape and position\nup above the pipeway. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOn 16 December 2002 at about 9 a.m., the Olone unit shift crew noted a\npoor supply of cyclohexane. Filters were changed, the pumps checked,\nthe DN100 mm main pipe inspected and the ADN unit interrogated. The\nfollowing day, as the problem persisted, a visual inspection of the\nDN50 mm branch pipe was organised.

The leak was initially estimated at a few tonnes. The operator took a physical stock 10 days later and reassessed the leak at between 850 and 1,200 tonnes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the leak, the cyclohexane was mostly absorbed into the gravelly ground. Only a few small pools of solidified cyclohexane could be seen below the leak; a fraction of the cyclohexane also escaped into the atmosphere as gas. At the upper surface of the water table at a depth of some 15 metres, the cyclohexane tended to spread rapidly (floating pool). After a few days, the cyclohexane spill was in four forms in the subsoil: &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- A pool of cyclohexane floating at the top of the water table, representing 70 to 85% of the tonnage spilt from the leak;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Cyclohexane captured in the subsoil by capillary action representing 15 to 30 % of the tonnage spilt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Cyclohexane dissolved in the water table (less than 1 % of the tonnage spilt);&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Cyclohexane in gaseous form in the subsoil (less than 1% of the tonnage spilt).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pool of floating cyclohexane accounted for the largest part of the cyclohexane spilt. It was also the source of supply for the cyclohexane captured in the subsoil by capillary action, the cyclohexane dissolved in the water table and the cyclohexane present in gaseous form. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pollution of the water table, one of the biggest in the region in the last 10 years, is a risk of contamination for mains drinking water catchments and agricultural bore holes located below it. The cyclohexane did not catch fire or explode. The flash point was not reached. The overall cost of the leak and the actions that followed is estimated at 2 M euros.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"Human":[0],"Environmental":[1],"Cost":[0],"Disruption":[0]},"HumanOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"HumanOffSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"DetailHumanOffSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Establishment total at risk","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"immediate fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"subsequent fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"hospitalizing injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other serious injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"health monitoring","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true}],"DetailHumanOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Establishment total at risk","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"immediate fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"subsequent fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"hospitalizing injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other serious injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"health monitoring","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true}],"DetailHumanEmergency":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Establishment total at risk","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"immediate fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"subsequent fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"hospitalizing injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other serious injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"health monitoring","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true}],"EnvironmentalOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"inland: metropolitan development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"inland: urban development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"inland: rural development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"inland: parkland/commonland","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"inland: grassland/pasture/meadow","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"inland: arable land/crops/vineyards/orchards","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"inland: woodland;
