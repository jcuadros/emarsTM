The installation was built in 1989. The raw materials are stored in silos before grinding and mixing operations. The finished product is then sent in bulk or in bags.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The site is classified with an authorisation, issued with prefectoral order of 19th June 1989, mainly for grinding vegetable substances. The site does not fall within the scope of the Seveso Directive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The accident: A violent explosion occurred in correspondence with the handling tower.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The accident is classified at level 2 of the accident gravity scale due to the fact that one employee died as a result of the explosion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This kind of accident is unfortunately not an exceptional event. The accident is notified with the objective of ensuring that this kind of situation is better known and taken more into consideration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The accident&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 10:00 h on 14th May 2001 a truck arrived at the plant to deliver 29 t of colza press cakes. The driver started unloading operations in the receiving pit of the brick silo (storage hangar).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the same time two workers started working on the delivery redler conveyor of the brick silo, trying to repair the scraper driving chain. The repair operation consisted in cutting the chain and welding some links after removing the redler conveyor cover on the side facing the pit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A violent explosion occurred at 11:15 h.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The truck driver who was near the discharging platform was slightly burned. The two workers in the pit were seriously injured (3rd degree burns). One worker managed to get out of the pit on his own. He activated the emergency shut-down switch of the handling tower. His colleagues made him sit on a chair while waiting for the emergency response service. The emergency response service arrived approximately 10 minutes after having been called. The other worker was lying unconscious in the pit. He was brought out after 1/2 hour by the fire brigade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The explosion was heard in the neighbourhood and was followed by a fire in the pit, in the hopper and in the areas of the tower and the gallery above the cells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The hot gases and/or incandescent particles ignited the dust deposits in the air circulation system of the cylindrical silos located a few meters away but a few meters above the horizontal silos. The fire fighters were alerted by the smoke plumes and intervened rapidly to fight the fire, thus avoiding the propagation of the fire to the vertical cylindrical storage cells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The explosion blew over half the roofing of the structure away and tore the walls of the tower open. Pieces of fibro-cement roofing panels were found at 30 m distance and several metal rods of the staircase giving access to the vertical silos were severed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The descending duct of the bucket conveyor employed for the silage of the press cakes was ripped open over a length of 4 m at the bottom of the pit section as well as at 2/3 height of the tower.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;

Large quantities of grain and dust accumulated in the pits, on all surfaces, forming layers which in some places reached several dozens of centimetres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A maintenance operation involving metal welding and grinding was performed in a confined space, a fire permit was signed as a pure formality without performing any cleaning operation. The workers performed the operation on the delivery redler conveyor while the elevator bucket conveyor was operating. Inside the bucket conveyor the atmosphere was saturated with dust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The discharging operation of the truck was almost concluded and welding and grinding operations had been finished when the explosion occurred.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on the analysis of the elements gathered on the accident site and tests performed, the competent authorities consider the following accident scenario as most probable:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Initially several metal particles deriving from the grinding operations were projected and fell * either on the bottom of the pit igniting one or more combustion spots .........* or in the chutes of the conveyor before coming into contact with the dusty atmosphere of the descending side of an elevator. Holes have been found in some junction boxes and switching boxes of the handling equipment which may have allowed such a pathway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Following this&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* a primary explosion occurred in a descending duct of the elevator (conveyor) at the level of the handling tower pit;&lt;br&gt;* the explosion in the elevator spread to the handling tower pit due to suspension of the dust present in the pit; &lt;br&gt;* the rupture of the shell of the descending duct of the elevator in correspondence with the second level of the handling tower propagated the explosion throughout the entire tower.&lt;br&gt;* at the same time the explosion in the pit affected the upper part of the tower through the openings&lt;br&gt;* the explosion of the tower spread towards the rest of the storage and the roofing structure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pit in which the explosion occurred is a strategic maintenance node were the feeding and extraction systems serving the entire silo system of the company are localised and are in communication.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as the operator is concerned the most probable cause of the accident was a blocked rotating element of the
