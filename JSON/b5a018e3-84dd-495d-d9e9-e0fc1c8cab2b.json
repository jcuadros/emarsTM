At the time of the accident, he was closing the manhole of the reactor after loading solid raw materials through the manhole. The manhole lid was blown off by the explosion in the reactor and hit the operator in the face. The operator died instantaneous. The manhole was found several meters from the reactor. The sprinklers in the production building were automatically activated by the fire in the reactor. Neighbouring equipment was slightly damaged due to projectiles from the explosion. The accident had no consequences for the environment or for the surroundings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Process description&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reactor is the first step in the batch production of polyesteracrylates. In the reactor polyols are esterificated with acrylic acid. This endothermic reaction is operated at ambient pressure and at a temperature between 80°C and 120°C. &lt;br&gt;The process exists of different consecutive steps in different equipment (reaction, washing, filtration, stripping and concentration) and needs many manual interventions by the operator. The installations are located in a closed building.&lt;br&gt;The accident happened in the loading phase of the reactor, which consists of:&lt;br&gt;- loading of liquid catalyst from an isobulkcontainer (IBC). It is sucked in the reactor by putting the reactor under vacuum. This is done manually at the reactor.&lt;br&gt;- manual loading of small quantities of solid raw materials (prepared in buckets) through the manhole&lt;br&gt;- loading of solvent (toluene) from the bulk tank (controlled by DCS)&lt;br&gt;- loading of acrylic acid from a bulk storage tank (controlled by DCS).&lt;br&gt;The reaction is controlled by the process computer (DCS) through the flow rate of acrylic acid and the temperature. The operator checks the pH of a sample of the reaction product to determine whether the reaction is completed. If so, the product is transferred to the wash vessel and the reactor is rinced with the solvent toluene, which is afterwards also added to the wash vessel. The reaction product and the wash toluene are transferred to the wash vessel using compressed air. &lt;br&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;

According to the company, in the initial design this was judged to be necessary to assure the acrylic acid inhibitor to inhibit the undesired autopolymerisation of the acid. &lt;br&gt;- Flammable substance&lt;br&gt;The reactor is washed with toluene between two batches. After the washing, there are still toluene vapours present in the reactor. Calculations performed by the company before the accident estimate the concentration of the toluene/air mixture at approx. 5 vol%. Given the explosion limits of toluene of 1,2 vol% and 7 vol% at ambient temperature, the reactor contained an explosive toluene/air mixture in the gas phase when the operator was manually loading raw materials through the open manhole. &lt;br&gt;The ignition of the toluene/air mixture is most likely due to an unwanted chemical reaction between the raw materials that were loaded manually through the manhole of the reactor. Laboratorium tests performed during the accident investigation identified a reaction between three of the five manually loaded solids. The heat production rate is low at ambient temperature but raises rapidly from 70°C on. At 90-100°C, a violent exothermic reaction occurs with the production of carbon oxide, carbon dioxide and phosphine. Phosphine autoignites at 100°C. The explosion was most likely an explosion of the toluene/air mixture in the reactor, ignited by the auto-ignition of phosphine. &lt;br&gt;Because the solid materials are added to a nearly empty reactor (contained only 100 liter of liquid catalyst), they could accumulate at the reactor wall below the manhole. This wall is supposed to have been at a temperature around 80°C, since the previous batch was stopped at 80°C and based on evidence that the cooling was not turned on before the operator started the loading of the next batch. This means that the reactor wall was at a temperature very close to the start of the runaway reaction between the solids.&lt;br&gt;The company claims that the normal operation was to load one third of the solvent before the manual addition of the additives. This would have avoided the accumulation of the solids to the reactor wall and hence the runaway reaction igniting the toluene vapour.&lt;br&gt;However the loading sequence was not clearly defined in the batch cards and instructions. Furthermore, the process computer software was not in accordance with the sequence supposed to be followed by the operators. During the last 15 years, several modifications were introduced (E.g. loading the solvent in two steps to avoid splashing when adding solid catalyst and raw materials,&amp;nbsp; change from solid to liquid catalyst). As a consequence, operators often only launched the new batch on the process computer after having loaded the catalyst and the solid raw materials. Since the cooling of&amp;nbsp; the reactor is only automatically activated by the DCS once the start of a new batch is launched on the process computer, this deviation in the loading procedure implied that the reactor was not cooled during manual loading unless the operator started the cooling manually. &lt;br&gt;The normal sequence implies an exposure to toluene vapours when loading the raw materials during the manhole. This exposure issue was formally identified by the company in risk and work place studies since 2001. Operators were supposed to wear breathing protection masks, but this was not formally and strictly imposed nor supervised. &lt;br&gt;Due to the lack of clear batch cards and instructions and the lack of supervision by management, the loading sequence differed from shift to shift and even between operators of the same shift. As for the sequence followed by the victim, some of the operators intended to avoid toluene exposure - and thus the need of wearing a breathing mask - by adding the toluene after all the manual loading via the manhole. &lt;br&gt;The risk study on the process was incomplete:&lt;br&gt;- not all process steps were addressed (E.g. toluene washing of the reactor between two batches)&lt;br&gt;- the explosion risk was not adequatly evaluated (only measures to avoid ignition source, no question whether oxygen was really needed during the loading phase)&lt;br&gt;- the loading sequence was not investigated (was supposed to be correct and followed in practice)&lt;br&gt;- not all risks were identified (dangerous reactions between raw materials, use of compressed air for the transfer of solvents between vessels).&lt;br&gt;An incident in July 2003 on a similar reactor indicated possible dangerous reactions between the solid raw materials.&amp;nbsp; The follow up of the conclusions of the incident investigation was insufficient. &lt;br&gt;A project aiming addition of all raw materials with closed systems (hoppers) and working in lean air conditions was planned for implementation later in 2006. &lt;br&gt;The organisational changes within the company over the last years significant influenced the delay in taking technical improvement measures. The establishment changed of legal entity mid 2004 with a view of being taken over by a worldwide group, with a freezing of investments as a consequence. The take over in 2005 lead to significant changes on management level and staffing.&amp;nbsp; The safety management system, which was in process of being adapted to the SMS guidelines of the new group who took over the company, did not assure an evaluation of the impact on safety of this kind of organisational changes.
