The control panel operator moved to the Battery Limits of units 2000 and 2100, where he succeeded in shutting (cutting, closing)&amp;nbsp; the crude oil charging valve&amp;nbsp; of the unit. Afterwards he closed (shut, cut) in the Battery Limits the valves of Unit 6100 and of the the slops.&lt;br&gt;An operator of Unit 2000 moved to to the Battery Limits with the goal to close the gas valve and all other valves, in order to isolate the unit.&lt;br&gt;A fix monitor (mounted extinguisher) placed in the room was put into service in order to protect the accumulator D 2004.&lt;br&gt;Approx. 3 or 4 minutes after the fire started, the shift electrician closed down the electric supply in the corresponding substation.&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile all other units of the lubricating oil plant were shut down.&lt;br&gt;When the Communication Control Room received information on \"emergency in Unit 2000\" , the general alarm and the onsite emergency plan were activated.&lt;br&gt;When the emergency response vehicles reached the place, immediately the emergency response co-ordinator (shift leader of the security service) started with the strategic disposition of human and material emergency response resources, integrating in the emergency response team also all the personnel of the unit&amp;nbsp; not needed for emergency process control measures.&lt;br&gt;The collaboration of the voluntary fire-brigade of Matosinhos-Le√ßa was also requested through the direct telephone line, which has been set up between the Communication Control Room and their headquarters. &lt;br&gt;The intervention of the voluntary fire-brigade, which responded to the request for support, was coordinated by the emergency response coordinator and can be summarised essentially in measures for cooling the equipment located in the area involved by the fire with the goal to avoid possible ruptures (failures) due to heat radiation of ( the heat emitted by) the fire.&lt;br&gt;During the extinguishing operations fire hoses, fix monitors (mounted extinguishers), water curtains with sprinklers, and fire-fighting vehicles were used, employing as extinguishing agents foam and powder&amp;nbsp; and water as cooling agent in order to avoid the risk of re-ignition, after having extinguished the fire.&lt;br&gt;Apart from measures directly linked to the extinguishing operations some water curtains were set-up (created, put into place) in order to avoid as far as possible the diffusion (expansion) of the fire.&lt;br&gt;The fire was considered as extinguished at 05:00:00.

It was foreseen that at the end of that shift the unit would have reached normal operating conditions.&lt;br&gt;When the accident occurred, at&amp;nbsp; 02:20 h of 19/06/1997,&amp;nbsp; unit 2000 was at the final start-up stage, it remained&amp;nbsp; only to introduce rectification vapour in column T 2002, raise the temperature to normal operating values in furnaces H 2001 and H 2002,&amp;nbsp; the feed (charge) of crude oil was of 90 m3/h (cubic metres an hour), the crude oil exiting from H 2001 had a temperature of 320¬∞C and the residues exiting from H 2002 had approx.the same temperature. Distillation products were collected already in both columns and were to be deviated through slops until information on the quality of the product was obtained.&lt;br&gt;Until the accident everything had been going on normally. &lt;br&gt;Attention must be drawn to the fact, that after the shut-down of the unit and the performance of major maintenance operations it is normal that minor leaks (releases) occur in equipment, the leaks are eliminated by tightening the fastening (fixing) elements. This is the reason why&amp;nbsp; in those circumstances the start-up of the units is performed slower in order to allow the detection of possible (eventual) anomalies (disturbances), avoiding that these present a significant risk.&lt;br&gt;In fact the start up was to be slow, for the reasons indicated above, moreover there had been&amp;nbsp; a certain delay due to a leak which occurred in heat exchanger E 2001, which led to the reduction of the discharge. The introduction of the pipes of the heat exchangers in the respective (corresponding) bodies was made with the help of cradles in order to&amp;nbsp; avoid forcing or deforming the equipment, and thus to damage it.&lt;br&gt;The inspection services made a hydrostatic test on the heat exchanger (at a pressure of 37 kg on the body and 24 kg on the pipes, during one hour) after it had been assembled; according to the results of the acceptance test there had been no need of re-tightening.&lt;br&gt;An operator of&amp;nbsp; Unit 2000 detected the leak (release) which was at the origin of the accident; while he was putting into operation one burner of the furnace H 2002 he saw a very large cloud inside that unit, originating in the upper part (top) of one of the connection joints between the body and the primary chamber (antechamber) of the heat exchanger E 2007B, on the north side. The release assumed the form of a fan and pushed by the wind, which was blowing strongly, it moved towards column T 2005. &lt;br&gt;The detection of the leak (release) occurred between 02:15 h and 02:20 h and was immediately communicated to the control room. At 02:20 the product originating from the leak (release) ignited (took fire) in the area corresponding to the pumps P 2008&amp;nbsp; A and B. The fire expanded rapidly in direction of column T 2005, reaching the base of D
