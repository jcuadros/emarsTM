Then, according to the reconstruction made by the holders, the staff took steps to stop the flow of water from the wells of the hydraulic barrier (set up for reclamation of the site) to the API separator pool. At the same time the company contracted to perform emergency operations was immediately alerted in order to remove the product from the square load and the APIpool. Later, at about 9:00 am, technicians of the company that operates the sewage treatment plant of the city arrived at the factory to inquire about the registration of the anomalous presence of hydrocarbons at the inlet of its wastewater treatment plant. After having assessed the situation, the staff had taken steps to close (with difficulty) the valve located downstream of the pool API directly leading to the sewer outside the plant and connected to the sewage treatment plant itself. By the information transmitted to the central authorities by the local Fire Brigade, the request for assistance to the firemen at the Oil Depot was received at 10:59 on February 23, 2010 in relation to difficulties encountered in closing the valve from the tank API that connects the sewer to the main collector and from here at the treatment plant of the city.In this regard it should be noted that the emergency procedures of the establishment provide an immediate calling of the fire brigade in case of uncontrollable events within the plant. Off-Site Several containment actions have been put in place along the first river, downstream of treatment plant of city, and along the second river downstream of the confluence with the first river as a result of activation of the emergency occurred at approximately 8:00 am . The treatment plant of the city acted as physical barrier to contain part of the products along the first river. In addition to it the garrison prepared to contain products in corrispondence of an hydroelectric power plant river dam along the second river made it possible to mitigate the effects by limiting quantities of hydrocarbons released in the second river and protecting downstream uses in place of drinking water supply and irrigation, aquaculture and fish farming in the second river delta and the nearby sea. At the treatment plant of the city were recovered (by means auto drain) and disposed about 2,638 tons of oil/water emulsion (data up to March 2, 2010) with an average of 47%of hydrocarbons. At the power plant river dam were recovered most of the quantities of product not retained by the wastewater treatment plant and from the oil barriers played on the first river. The action of containment was achieved by raising the gates of the dam in order to facilitate the flow of water at the bottom and the containment of hydrocarbons on the surface. The product, consisting of a very viscous oil/water emulsion, was recovered using firstly oil skimmers. The process, due to the accumulation of plant debris that did not allow the proper functioning of the equipment, was secondarily guaranteed by means bucket load on a recovery barge. To facilitate the containment and recovery of hydrocarbons at the river dam, actions has been taken to facilitate the accumulation of the floating products on the right side of the river. With regard to actions aimed to wildlife preservation, action was done to removal of the birds in wildlife reserves by means helicopter flybys."],"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastUser":{"UserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"Name":["MINERVA"],"Surname":["Administrator"],"IsVisibleSensibleData":[false]},"LastDate":["2017-07-11T15:59:38.731"],"ParentCompany":{},"Region":{},"Province":{},"City":{},"PostCode":{},"Concurrency":[0]},"LockedUserId":{},"LockedDate":{},"IsLocked":[false],"IsLockedByMe":[false],"LockedUser":{}},"AccidentProfile_Tab":{"ReportingAuthority":{},"ContactPerson":{},"Reasons":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Substances involved: greater than 5% of quantity in Column 3 of Annex I"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Injury to persons: &gt;= 1 fatalities, &gt;= 6 hospitalizing injuries etc."},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Immediate damage to the environment (according to Annex VI)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Damage to property: on-site &gt;2M &amp;euro;, off-site &gt; 0.5M &amp;euro;"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"Cross-border damage: transboundary accidents"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"Interesting for lessons learned."}],"AffectedCountries":{}},"AccidentDescription_Tab":{"AccidentDescription":{"DominoEffects":[false],"NatechEvents":[false],"TransboundaryEffects":[false],"Contractors":[false],"accTypeRelease":[0],"accTypeFire":[0],"accTypeExplosion":[0],"accTypeTransport":[0],"accTypeOther":{},"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastDate":["2017-07-11T16:00:08.689"],"Concurrency":[0],"Translation":{"VersionId":["cde27223-190b-a0c8-acbf-e0ab13376be1"],"LanguageId":["EN"],"AccidentDescription":["&lt;span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"&gt;The event took place in different stages since the early morning hours of February 23, 2010 within the depot of mineral oil and consisted of the spill, caused by an intentional action, of about 2,600 tons of hydrocarbons (Diesel fuel and Heavy fuel oil) from the pipes of the loading docks of the plant and in the repayment of the product.

spill are the nearby river downstream of treatment plant of the town,the second river from the mouth of the first nearby river to the lagoons of the delta and coastal marine waters in front of the zone directly influenced by waters of the second river.In the emergency phase the quantity of the mixture of hydrocarbons (oil / fuel oil) being present in these water bodies, and their impact on water quality have been different, particularly severe on the first river and to a lesser extent in the second river and progressive decreasing to the sea,due to the dilution effect caused by the various tributaries of the second river's valley to the mouth of nearby river and the heavy rains. The emergency allowed the recovery of a quantity of product upstream of the sewage treatment equal to- 1250 tons retrieved at the treatment plant of the town - 300 tons recovered in the yards of Oil Depot for a total of about 1550 tons of product. Of the remaining 1050 tonnes of oil released into the nearby river downstream of the treatment plant of the town have been recovered: - 100 tons by means curtains made in the rivers - 450 tons at the dam on the second river for a total of about 550 tons of recovered product. Therefore about 500 tons are scattered along the rivers between the treatment plant of the town and the sea with a total length of river courses involved more than 300 Km. The extensive data collected show that the immediate consequences of the spill occurred at the superficial part of rivers consist mainly in a \"black wave\" of hydrocarbons that has passed between 23 and 28 February 2010. Along the stretch of the nearby river downstream of the treatment plant of the town to the confluence with the second river a WWF protected area and some urban parks in other nearby towns were involved. Downstream from the mouth of the first river along the shaft of second river are present n. 27 ZPS-SIC bordering sites designated and protected under the \"Habitats\" Directive 92/43/EEC and \"Birds\" Directive 79/409/EEC (recently revised by Directive 2009/147/EC). In a short time n.10 specimens belonging to two different species (cormorant and mallard) recovered in the hours following the event were died. From the findings identified by postmortem examinations apparent cause of death is poisoning not only by ingestion of hydrocarbons but also by transcutaneous absorption or inhalation. At the moment, an estimate of the animals killed by substances leaking is difficult, because many specimens of birds have been poisoned to death in remote and secluded areas. A comprehensive estimate of the damages is also difficult for the aquatic plant and animal communities that inhabit the ecosystems involved. Currently it is not possible to determine with certainty the actual amount of permanent or long-term damages to the various habitats caused by oil transit along the river courses and not intercepted by the actions of emergency put in place. Monitoring studies are being carried out under EC Directive 2000/60 involving different technical bodies both at central level and locally, with the goal of assessing the extent and impact caused by the discharge of hydrocarbons on the various environmental media (water, sediment, aquatic plant and animal communities). Only at the end of the monitoring activity it will be possible to obtain a complete picture of the actual extent of the damage, taking also into account the potential impact of the event on other water bodies and protected areas linked to the area directly affected by the oil spill. On-site The area affected by the event of release is located inside the industrial site and it is extended about 19,000 square meters. The first area of intervention has involved about 5000 square meters of land in front of the loading docks. First emergency activities have led to the production of solid waste due to the shelling of the land and the use of oil-absorbent material as well as aspiration of liquid waste from square, the API tank and the removal of the contaminated fluids derived from the decontamination of infrastructure in the depot. The solid waste has been stored in the establishment and partly disposed of by means of roll-off boxes and semi-ponds. The total quantity of soil/solid waste product is approximately 1700 tons for a fraction of oil products of 18 tons (identified on the basis of measured concentrations from the analysis of land). The liquid waste has been stored in tanks inside the plant provided by the Company. The amount of liquid waste was: 1060 tons of product hydrocarbon emulsions 569 tons of contaminated water 54 mc of sludge contaminated with hydrocarbons"],"Human":[0],"Environmental":[1],"Cost":[1],"Disruption":[0]},"HumanOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"HumanOffSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"DetailHumanOffSite":{},"DetailHumanOnSite":{},"DetailHumanEmergency":{},"EnvironmentalOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"inland: metropolitan development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"inland: urban development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"inland: rural development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"inland: parkland/commonland","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"inland: grassland/pasture/meadow","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"inland: arable land/crops/vineyards/orchards","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"inland: woodland;
