Given the presence of flames in the upper level area, the workers intervened immediately, as provided for in the Emergency Intervention Plan (PEI), and tried to extinguish them with portable fire extinguishers. Although the fire extinguishers were used promptly, they were not sufficient to put out the flames, given that the fire had spread with extreme speed and reached the roofing panels. The foreman (and the fire safety officer), having realised that it was not possible to tackle the emergency with the firefighting equipment on site, ordered the evacuation of all workers present and took steps to secure the plant, specifically by: turning off the electricity in the area affected by the fire and the immediate vicinity; cutting off the gas and liquid fuel supply. At the same time, the other fire safety officer called the Fire Brigade. When the fire brigade and ambulance service arrived on the scene, at around 14.05, a considerable area of the plant was already on fire and - to be more precise - the west wing, partly used for production and partly as a store for polyurethane sandwich panels. Given the speed with which the blaze spread, aided by the wind, and the intense production of thick black smoke, the combustibility of the products present, the huge quantities of product in storage and finally the presence of a storage tank of inflammable liquids (polyol and isocyanate), the sole operational possibility was to avoid the fire spreading to other adjacent areas both to the east and the west. The laminated wooden frame connecting the reinforced concrete and metal load bearing pillars was totally burned in the fire, causing the structural collapse of the roof and the lateral buffer walls, which imploded.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At approximately 19.00, the moment at which the flammable liquids in the metal above-ground storage tanks located to the west of the plant stopped burning, the fire could be considered under control, although the material stacked inside continued to produce flames and smoke even after that time. The extinguishing operation continued throughout the night and part of the next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Overall 22 fire engines and other devices, including a helicopter and an air tank, were used to extinguish the fire, contributed by various Fire Brigades. All the staff present implemented the internal emergency plan properly. The prompt activation of the emergency plan meant that all the workers were grouped together in a safe area and the fire was prevented from spreading to the dangerous substances on site in the plant. The external emergency plan was also activated. The technical departments of the relevant health and environmental agencies were instructed to monitor and test the water, air and soil in the province concerned and the neighbouring province. Pending the results of the monitoring and tests, the mayors of the relevant municipalities issued emergency orders adopting a series of precautionary measure to protect public health. The measures were maintained for ten days, until the test results received back from the various laboratories confirmed that the concentrations were below legal limits in all environmental media (air, water and soil).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After the emergency, and the clean up of the water used to extinguish the fire inside the building that was collected in the water recovery system and of the surrounding area, the plant restarted operations immediately.&lt;/p&gt;"],"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["6799492a-0079-4d05-aad1-8f4dce857337"],"LastUser":{"UserId":["6799492a-0079-4d05-aad1-8f4dce857337"],"Name":["Enrico"],"Surname":["GUAGNINI"],"IsVisibleSensibleData":[false]},"LastDate":["2018-12-21T16:57:33.89"],"ParentCompany":{},"Region":{},"Province":{},"City":{},"PostCode":{},"Concurrency":[0]},"LockedUserId":{},"LockedDate":{},"IsLocked":[false],"IsLockedByMe":[false],"LockedUser":{}},"AccidentProfile_Tab":{"ReportingAuthority":{},"ContactPerson":{},"Reasons":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Substances involved: greater than 5% of quantity in Column 3 of Annex I"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Injury to persons: &gt;= 1 fatalities, &gt;= 6 hospitalizing injuries etc."},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Immediate damage to the environment (according to Annex VI)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Damage to property: on-site &gt;2M &amp;euro;, off-site &gt; 0.5M &amp;euro;"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"Cross-border damage: transboundary accidents"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"Interesting for lessons learned."}],"AffectedCountries":{}},"AccidentDescription_Tab":{"AccidentDescription":{"DominoEffects":[false],"NatechEvents":[false],"TransboundaryEffects":[false],"Contractors":[true],"accTypeRelease":[0],"accTypeFire":[0],"accTypeExplosion":[0],"accTypeTransport":[0],"accTypeOther":{},"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["6799492a-0079-4d05-aad1-8f4dce857337"],"LastDate":["2018-12-21T16:57:33.89"],"Concurrency":[0],"Translation":{"VersionId":["04a4d7ca-af62-4778-aabb-884152cb6a3b"],"LanguageId":["EN"],"AccidentDescription":["&lt;p&gt;The incident started in the upper level above the panel foam production area for production line 3, at a height of approximately 4 metres above floor level. This upper level area was partially closed on the side and adjacent to the finished products store (polyurethane sandwich panels). The upper level area is not clearly defined as one of the plant’s units (storage/production); its function was to reduce the volume of the production area below to ensure that it was sufficiently warm to enable the reaction needed to produce polyurethane foam, which is a continuous process. Some polyethylene spools were stored in the upper level area, even though they were not used there. The spools were in fact used in the panel finishing production line. During the incident, production line 3 was in operation under the upper level area, where polyurethane panels were being manufactured using pentane (from the raw material tank MP via an underground pipe that was cut off at source during the fire, at the point where it is turned on at the pump, by the operator manually blocking the production line) and using the catalyst (taken from the MP tank via an underground pipe from the tank that was subsequently entirely destroyed in the blaze). The fire, which started in the upper level, rapidly spread to the production line below, the rock wool panel production line, the curved panel production line, a finished products store (storage area 3), a stock of chemical products comprising five tanks for storing isocyanate of 35 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

The fire notably destroyed the rock wool panel production line, the curved panel production line, a finished product store (store 3), a stock of chemical products comprising five tanks for storing isocyanate of 35 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; each, five tanks for storing polyol of 35 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; each and two tanks for storing the catalyst (N&amp;nbsp;N-dimethylcyclohexylamine) of 12.5 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; each + 20 movable containers of 1 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; each.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Burning polyurethane and its individual components create toxic smoke. The plume of smoke rose to a height of approximately 400 metres; the inversion of the vertical thermal gradient resulted in an interface that acted as a roof&amp;nbsp;coming into contact with the cloud of smoke. The cloud moved north-west, borne on a light wind, spreading over a couple of kilometres before completely dispersing into the atmosphere. The relatively calm weather meant that the plume of smoke reached considerable distances with regard to its point of origin as it scarcely mixed with the surrounding air. The huge fire produced a black cloud that could be seen from kilometres away, as declared by the Prefecture, and spreaded over the connecting streets (closed to traffic) and the surrounding areas; the Prefecture declared a state of emergency to ensure the intervention of the fire brigade and ambulances and adopted precautionary measures to safeguard the population. The relevant health and environmental agencies were instructed to monitor and test the area&amp;rsquo;s water, air and soil in the province concerned and the neighbouring province, belonging to other region. Pending the results of the monitoring and tests, the mayors of the municipalities concerned issued emergency orders adopting a series of precautionary measures to protect public health.&amp;nbsp; On 8 April following the results of the monitoring plan, almost all the restrictive measures were lifted. As a purely precautionary measure, certain restrictions on livestock grazing and harvesting fodder in the area concerned were maintained. The tests carried out by the environmental agencies detected a concentration of toxic substances below the legal limits for both the air and the soil.&lt;/p&gt;"],"Human":[0],"Environmental":[2],"Cost":[3],"Disruption":[0]},"HumanOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"HumanOffSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"DetailHumanOffSite":{},"DetailHumanOnSite":{},"DetailHumanEmergency":{},"EnvironmentalOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"inland: metropolitan development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"inland: urban development","Quantity":0,"Effect":"Temporary traffic interruption.
