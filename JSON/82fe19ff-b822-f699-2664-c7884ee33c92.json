At about 11:50 this spare pump was switched-on and, immediately after, a leakage from a piping located above the operators occurred. They quickly escaped towards the control room before the gas was ignited by the pyrolysis furnace. The Internal Emergency Plan was activated. The unit was shut-down and fire protection means were activated while the affected area was evacuated. The fire was not extinguished to avoid formation of an explosive gas cloud; at the same time the protection of structures exposed to intense heat radiation using cooling via fixed monitors and of the pyrolysis furnace by means of a fixed water curtain was necessary. Isolation valves around the unit on fire were closed to reduce the amount of flammable substances potentially involved. However, one of the isolation valves could not be completely closed (because the accident occurred during a test) and therefore the duration of the fire was prolonged. After 10 minutes other pipes were ruptured causing an escalation of the fire, which was finally extinguished after 13 hours (at about 00:45). Damages to the plant were confined to an area of 20-25m radius on a platform at an elevation of 6m. A nearby school was evacuated when a hydrogen chloride concentration of 10-15ppm was measured in the vicinity. Hydrogen chloride concentrations measured indicate that confinment should have been preferred versus the evacuation. Ambient air monitoring performed by the local mobile chemical emergency intervention unit could detect only traces of toxic gases.

Besides, further studies confirmed that the installation of a diaphragm with an opening smaller than originally planned (in order to obtain a more accurate measure of the liquid flow) aggravated the erosion (the diameter reduction of the diaphragm from 192mm to 132mm caused an increase of the liquid speed of a factor of 2.1 and of the turbulence effects of a factor of 4.5). In effects, the piping, in a zone downstream 10-60cm the diaphragm, showed a higher erosion than in the other section and therefore, when the spare pump was switched-on, the liquid flow was sufficient to rupture the pipe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"Other":[""]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["d6bac186-a5c9-2124-bf22-2874963cc64b"],"Consequence_Description":["EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:&lt;br&gt;Inside the establishment 1 person was hospitalized by psychological shock due to the flash fire.

These precautionary measures were taken up to 16:15.&amp;nbsp; SOLVAY personnel performed toxic gas measurements near the school C.E.S. in the city of Tavaux. Concentrations of about 10-15ppm of hydrogen chloride were measured and the school (50 pupils) was evacuated towards a school in Dole.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The fire was extinguished by the plant fire brigade (58 people).&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Ecological harm - Remarks: Ambient air monitoring performed by the local mobile chemical emergency intervention unit could detect only traces of toxic gases.
