A chlorine\ndetector, located 3 metres away from the sodium hypochlorite transfer\ntank, activated an alarm (it was set to operate at a chlorine\nconcentration in air of 1 ppm).

A\n4 men rescue team was formed and instructed to enter the pickling\nsection to check if someone was still there. They were also instructed\nto switch-off the equipment. The rescue team found that the sodium\nhydroxide transfer tank had overflowed and the liquid had run into the\ntank below containing water, nitric acid and hydrogen fluoride. The\npump which was transferring the sodium hypochloryte from the storage\ntank to the transfer tank had stopped.

&lt;/b&gt;The accident occurred in the storage area of the second cold rolling\nmill's pickling section of a metal industry (the location of the second\ncold rolling mill is shown in Fig. 1 attached to the Original Report).\nIn the pickling section the oxide layer (formed during hot rolling and\nannealing) was removed from the surface of the metal. Pickling was\nperformed in baths (10m long, 40m3 capacity) with water containing\nHF(1%-3%) and HNO3 (4%-6%) at 50°C-60°C. During the oxides dissolution,\nthe fumes produced (containing HNO3, HF, NO2 and NO) were aspirated by\nmeans of ventilators and scrubbed in two stages (the system block\ndiagram is shown in Fig. 3 attached to the Original Report). Nitric\nacid was neutralized in the first absorption tower with sodium\nhydroxide. Nitrogen oxide was oxidized whilst nitrogen dioxide was\nreduced with an alkaline solution of KMnO4. The waste waters from the\nabsorption towers, containing nitrites and nitrates, were neutralized\nwith sodium hypochlorite added from a 2 m3 transfer tank automatically\nfilled by means of a pump. This pump automatically started when the\nminimum level in the transfer tank was reached and stopped when the\nmaximum level was reached. The tanks containing the liquids used in the\npickling section were located in the storage area, as shown in Fig. 2\nattached to the Original Report. The following storage tanks are\nimportant for the accident: sodium hydroxide A, sodium hypochlorite B,\nsodium trisulphate C, sodium hypochlorite D, the 150 m3 tank where\nwater and acids were sometimes present (it was located under the sodium\nhypochlorite transfer tank E). When the accident occurred in the\nstorage area there were 6 employees: two people from Democo company\npainting the sodium hydroxide A and the sodium hypochlorite B storage\ntanks; two people of Decometa company fitting a heat exchanger to the\nsodium trisulphate storage tank C;

Therefore, when the level reached the maximum value, the valve did not stop the pump (the control had only temporarily jammed since the rescue team found that the pump had automatically stopped). The overfilling pipe was connected with a tank installed below, covered with a metal grid, which was containing water, nitric acid and hydrogen fluoride. The reaction of the sodium hypochlorite (a very strong oxidizing agent) with the two acids produced chlorine gas (by oxidation of chlorides) and probably fluoride gas (by oxidation of fluorides) but there is no evidence of it.\nBesides, the emergency level (i.e. the level at which the stop signal was given to the transfer pump) was too close to the overfilling pipe. This, together with the excessive length (about 75 metres) of the piping between the pump and the transfer tank, may cause the tank overfilling even if the pump stops when the liquid reaches the emergency level.\nFinally, the overfilling pipe from the transfer tank was erroneously connected (due to inadequate process analysis and plant design) with the tank below which may contain acids.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remarks: &lt;br&gt;No data are\navailable about the amount of released sodium hypochlorite and of\nnitric acid and hydrogen fluoride contained in the transfer tank. Also\nno data are available about the amount of the chlorine gas formed by\nthe reaction of sodium hypochlorite with nitric acid and hydrogen\nfluoride.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"Other":[""]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["72be53e6-66f2-84bc-7590-d146767a959e"],"Consequence_Description":["EFFECTS ON PEOPLE: 10 people were injured by the chlorine release.
