Highly explosive mixtures can ignite at the slightest opportunity, particularly if hot work is carried out without taking the necessary precautions. Aeration of the tank base is vital for safety reasons and must not be done away with for any reason.\nIn the ATEX Directive (96/92/EC) plants with tanks containing spent broths are classified as being at risk of the creation of explosive atmospheres, and ATEX and safety procedures must therefore be used.\nFor modifications, even temporary ones, the risks must be analysed using appropriate methods, such as HAZOP. The risks of such work must also be analysed.\nEmployees and workers from subcontract firms must be informed about and trained in safety procedures, and more importantly the unit heads must have a culture of safety, i.e. the strict application of safety procedures.\nAccidents of this kind may happen in future, also due to the expansion of biotechnology in different sectors. While many biotechnologies are malodorous, this unpleasant aspect cannot be eliminated at the cost of creating much more serious risks, as in this case.\n"],"EmergencyResponce_Descr":["The accident occurred at around 12 noon.

This work was being carried out by a subcontract firm as part of a temporary modification to the wastewater treatment unit. There was a confined explosion of gas inside the tank which led to the roof of the tank being projected approximately 20 metres; the explosion killed one subcontractor and injured four other workers (three subcontractors and one company employee), all of whom were working on the modification. The SFB supply line had been emptied of wastewater coming from the distillery unit. The air vent of the tank, located on the roof of the tank, had been open as usual. The tank was approximately 50% full. Five workers were carrying out the work, four from the external firm and one from the company itself. The external workers had disconnected the SFB line by removing the shut-off valve on the entry duct on the roof of Tank TKX without closing it with the port's blind flange. One worker was standing on the roof of the tank near the open flange; the others were on the walkway giving access to the roof of the tank. They were beginning to cut the existing tube using a disc saw; sparks most likely produced by contact between the disc and the tubing ignited the explosive atmosphere which, unknown to them, had collected inside the tank. There was a confined vapour explosion (CVE) inside the tank which projected the tank roof approximately 20 metres. The shock wave threw the worker standing on the roof onto that of the adjacent tank, killing him; pieces of the tank roof fell onto the other four workers standing on the walkway; the connected tubing was also thrown a great distance."],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;

The conditions inside the tank, i.e. the lack of oxygen, encouraged the formation of populations of anaerobic bacteria which initiated fermentation, thereby producing various highly inflammable gaseous compounds, such as hydrogen and methane, which are lighter than air. In addition, the presence of sulphates means that a series of other (sulphide) gases may be produced which are extremely inflammable and much heavier than air. A vent was present on the tank roof; this allowed only the circulation of the lighter-than-air gases.\nThe anaerobic conditions which led to the formation of the gases were due to a modification to the tank undertaken around ten years previously; this closed the air vents on the tank base which were included in the original plans. During operations the sediment would accumulate on the base of the tank in large quantities and under anaerobic conditions. The area had been considered to be non-dangerous within the meaning of the ATEX Directive.\nThe work had been decided on in order to carry out a temporary modification without, however, adequately assessing the risks. The internal hot work safety procedure (isolation, clean-up, use of an explosimeter) was not applied. The fact that the work was carried out when the tank was full meant that the ignition of inflammable gases was inevitable.\nVarious estimates have been made regarding the exact chemical breakdown of the gas inside the tank, but analyses and laboratory simulations seem to confirm that sulphide gases in layers lower down the tank were the main components, along with hydrogen and methane from layers higher up the tank.\n"],"Other":[""]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["eafdaba0-32fd-d5ba-ca03-7a4003b4fedf"],"Consequence_Description":["In human terms, the tank explosion caused the immediate death of a subcontract worker and injured four others (three subcontract workers and one company employee).\nThe worker who died was standing on the tank roof holding the flanged end of the SFB supply line which was to be cut. The explosion took place as soon as the disc saw touched the pipe. The roof was torn off along the welding line and thrown into the air; after flying over the adjacent tank TKZ it fell to earth around 20 metres away. The worker was thrown from the roof of the tank onto that of tank TKZ, where his body was found. He had probably landed on his back, thereby hitting the back of his head against one of the roof's reinforcing beams (double-t iron beams arranged in a radial pattern on the roof).\nThe four injured workers, who suffered first- and second-degree burns on various parts of the body, were thrown off the TKX walkway onto the nearby TKY tank and fell down the exit ladder; all were given first aid by the company medical service and then taken to Brindisi hospital where they were treated, with expected recovery times ranging from 40 to 200 days.\nThe material damage has been estimated at EUR 1.8 million for equipment and production losses, and EUR 0.8 million to restore the area to use, a total of EUR 2.6 million.\n"],"Human":[1],"Environmental":[0],"Cost":[0],"Disruption":[0]},"HumanOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","Quantity":1,"Effect":"","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","Quantity":4,"Effect":"prognosi 40, 120, 166 e 198 giorni","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"HumanOffSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"DetailHumanOffSite":{},"DetailHumanOnSite":{},"DetailHumanEmergency":{},"EnvironmentalOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"inland: metropolitan development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"inland: urban development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"inland: rural development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"inland: parkland/commonland","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"inland: grassland/pasture/meadow","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"inland: arable land/crops/vineyards/orchards","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"inland: woodland;
