The key findings of the report\nwere:·&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\na) the survey offered evidence that the physical and/or psychological\nhealth of a significant number of Sandhurst residents who replied to\nthe questionnaire were affected following the fire at CSG, although\nthese symptoms are generally thought to be self limiting;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nb) some people experienced symptoms that persisted beyond the study period.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nA follow-up questionnaire was developed with the help of community\nrepresentatives with a survey undertaken in the summer of 2001. In\nOctober 2001 Gloucestershire Health Authority produced its follow-up\nreport on the health impact from the incident at CSG. The key findings\nof the second self-reporting health surveillance survey were:·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\na) the physical and/or psychological health of a significant proportion\nof Sandhurst residents living in the projected path of the plume was\naffected following the fire at CSG (described as sore eyes and throat,\nitchy skin, chest pains, shortness of breath, coughing, diarrhoea,\nvomiting);&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nb) the majority of physical symptoms experienced resolved within 4 weeks;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nc) measures of psychological ill-health are no longer elevated;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nd) a small number of people report continuing symptoms 7 months after the incident.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe results of blood and urine samples from emergency service personnel\nand workers involved during the site clearance were also examined and\nshowed no evidence of chemical contamination. This evidence has been\ndiscussed with local and national experts and based on current evidence\nthere is not considered to be a long-term risk to health. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nHowever in response to the level of public concern, the Health\nAuthority has set up a 20-year study to monitor the community for any\nlong-term effects from the incident. The responsibility for conducting\nthe study passed to West Gloucestershire Primary Care Trust in April\n2002. The study project team has received health data relating to\nOctober 2000 to July 2004 but as yet the numbers of reports are\ninsufficient to allow meaningful comparisons. For the study population\nof 3872 people currently, there have been 66 cancer and 110 death\nnotifications received.This is within normal expectations in\nGloucestershire. Further notifications for this period may still be\nreceived. At the current rate of data accrual it is likley to take\n10-15 years to accumulate sufficient data to demonstrate any excess\nrisk. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nExpert medical opinion has suggested that in the case of one individual\na casual relationship between the onset of illness and exposure during\nthe incident is possible.&lt;br&gt;"],"LessonsLearned":["&lt;b&gt;Measures to prevent recurrence: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Environment Agency National Action Plan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the April 2001 report, the Agency detailed its National Action Plan for ensuring that the lessons learned from CSG Sandhurst are implemented across England and Wales. The plan covers seven key issues requiring review, these being:·&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Issue 1: Licensing arrangements at CSG Sandhurst·&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Issue 2: Licensing arrangements for chemical waste treatment and transfer facilities&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Issue 3: Emergency response arrangements&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Issue 4: The balance of maintaining customer confidence in the licensing process and taking enforcement action&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Issue 5: Officer awareness of Agency policy, procedures and practice on inspection and prosecution&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Issue 6: Environmental policies and procedures&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Issue 7: Health and Safety policy issues&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Specific actions are identified under each of the above issues, (21 in total), along with a manager responsible for taking the action forward and a target date for completion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;HSE Actions&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;HSE paper has been presented to the Hazardous Installations Directorate (HID) (Land Division) Management Board on the lessons identified during the investigation of the CSG incident. The report identified issues in four key areas that have been acted upon, these being:·&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;a) emergency response - substantial changes have been made to the Directorates emergency response arrangements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;b) working with the Agency - HID have progressed common operating instructions and procedures when working with the Agency as the Competent Authority and specific arrangements have been made to work more closely where COMAH does not apply.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;c) prior regulation of the site - HID have reviewed the arrangements made for carrying out \"prior role\" enquiries and are about to produce additional guidance for staff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;d) chemical waste treatment industry - a new joint inspection initiative involving the HSE and the Environment Agency was conducted in 2002 (see below).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joint Inspection Initiative&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A joint HSE and Agency inspection/enforcement initiative was undertaken because of concerns that arose not only from this incident, but incidents at other such sites. The inspection initiative was necessary both to ensure that health, safety and environment provisions are complied with and to demonstrate better standards of control within the industry. The joint inspection initiative included:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;a) a seminar with representatives of the chemical waste treatment and storage industry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;b) conducting inspections at waste treatment and transfer establishments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;c) providing feedback to the chemical waste treatment and storage industry. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The inspection initiative was formally launched at a seminar, held jointly by HSE and the Agency, on 14 May 2002 in Birmingham. The seminar was attended by about 50 representatives of the industry, including representatives from both large national companies and from small/medium enterprises. Senior HSE and Agency staff introduced the seminar, outlining issues of concern and the purpose and implementation of the inspection initiative.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The seminar encouraged an open discussion with the industry that recognised the need to take action to ensure compliance and to improve the public perception of its activities. One of the outcomes was that the Agency, HSE and the industry will develop better communications and if necessary produce an industry code of practice to set standards for health and safety controls that are specific to this business. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A report of the findings of the joint enforcement and inspection programme was published in February 2004.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Useful References:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"Report For The Deputy Prime Minister The Right Honourable John Prescott MP into the major fire on 30 October 2000 at Cleansing Service Group Ltd, Upper Parting Works, Sandhurst Lane, Sandhurst, Gloucester GL2 9NQ\"&lt;br&gt;(http://www.hse.gov.uk/hid/sandhurst/csg1rept.htm)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Progress Report For The Deputy Prime Minister The Right Honourable John Prescott MP (April 2001)&lt;br&gt;(http://www.hse.gov.uk/hid/sandhurst/sandhurst2.htm)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Progress Report For The Deputy Prime Minister The Right Honourable John Prescott MP (July 2002)&lt;br&gt;(http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/commondata/acrobat/csg_update_report_july_02.pdf)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Final Report for Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Department for Works and Pensions (September 2003) (http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/commondata/acrobat/csg_sep_03._609513.pdf)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;HSL Work following the fire at CSG Ltd., Upper Parting Works, 30th October 2000, FR/01/08&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;HSL Report on potential mechanism for fire propagation at CSG&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hazardous Waste Storage and Treatment Facilities 2002/2003.

The fire rapidly spread to the rest of the transfer station, resulting in the violent rupture of numerous 205 litre drums and small aerosols. There were no on-site casualties. Some off-site ill-health symptoms have been reported, but there is currently no conclusive evidence of long-term impairment of the health of any members of the public.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The incident was compounded by serious flooding in the area causing the site to be cut-off four days after the incident, and accessible only by boat. The majority of the site itself was flooded to varying depths.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The incident is reportable as it meets the following criteria:&lt;br&gt;a) COMAH schedule 7, Part 1, para 1(a) - a fire involving a quantity of at least 5% of the qualifying quantity (for top-tier application of very toxics), and&lt;br&gt;b) COMAH schedule 7, Part 1, para 1(b)(v) - evacuation of persons/time being greater then 500 hours. On the day, 60 people were evacuated for 12 hours. Further evacuations occurred the next week due to concern about possible on-going side effects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Type of accident - Remarks: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A fire occurred at approximately 02.00 on Monday 30 October 2000 in a waste storage area at Cleansing Service Group Ltd (CSG), Upper Parting Works, Sandhurst, Gloucester. The site is a licensed waste treatment facility and transfer station for a wide range of hazardous waste chemical substances and is notified as a Control of Major Accident Hazard Regulations 1999 (COMAH) Lower Tier site. The fire originated in compound 1 of the waste transfer station in the southwest of the site which was unoccupied at the time, rapidly spreading to other areas of the site.\n\nThe incident occurred at a time of severe storms with gale force winds and very heavy rain. Wind speeds peaked at 50 - 60 mph. These extreme weather conditions continued to cause problems throughout the day.\n\nThe Fire Service accessed the site via the fields to the south, due to the very strong prevailing wind from the south. Throughout the day, water and foam were applied to the fire which was concentrated at the south end of the site. The fire was eventually fully extinguished by 18.00 on the 30 October, having burned for approximately 16 hours, although a number of drums involved in the fire continued to smoulder. The fire was restricted to the waste transfer area and did not affect the bulk tank storage on site. Most of the firewater was retained on site, by site containment measures, but some contaminated water escaped and had to be pumped back.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meteorological conditions - Remarks: &lt;/b&gt;Details above from Met Office via Gloucester Fire Service.\nSevere weather warning issued by the Met Office at 04:07 Monday 30th October 2000 (affecting Gloucestershire): severe south westerly gales with damaging gusts to around 80mph and outbreaks of heavy rain will gradually clear eastwards during the morning. The strong winds are significant as this is the possible cause of drum falling and initiating the incident. Also significant in spread and severity of fire.&lt;br&gt;Precipitation: rain; Wind speed: 216.00; Wind direction: SSW; Wind stability: D; Temperature: 12.00&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chronology of incident:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- On Monday 30 October 2000 at approximately 02.00, a fire occurred in compound 1 of the waste transfer station in the southwest of the site (unoccupied at the time).&lt;br&gt;- First call to the emergency services was logged at 02.19 and the Fire Service arrived on the scene within 6 minutes.&lt;br&gt;- Agency staff attended immediately. HSE and other parties, including Gloucestershire Health Authority (GHA), also attended during the incident.&lt;br&gt;- The Fire Service was unable to approach the site for some hours because of the intensity of the fire and small aerosol cans exploding.&lt;br&gt;- The incident occurred at a time of severe storms with gale force winds and very heavy rain. Wind speeds peaked at 50 - 60 mph. These extreme weather conditions continued to cause problems throughout the day.&lt;br&gt;- The Fire Service set-up a forward command post in the car park of the Globe public house, located on Sandhurst Lane approximately 1km south of the site. At approximately 10.40, this site was evacuated due to the expected flooding of Sandhurst Lane. The command post was re-established at the southern end of the lane, approximately 2 km from the site.&lt;br&gt;- The Fire Service accessed the site via the fields to the south, due to the very strong prevailing wind from the south. Throughout the day, water and foam were applied to the fire which was concentrated at the south end of the site.&lt;br&gt;- The fire was eventually fully extinguished by 18.00 on the 30 October, having burned for approximately 16 hours, although a number of drums involved in the fire continued to smoulder.&lt;br&gt;- The fire was restricted to the waste transfer area and did not affect the bulk tank storage on site. Most of the firewater was retained on site, by site containment measures, but some contaminated water escaped and had to be pumped back.&lt;br&gt;- The Fire Service remained in attendance overnight. They relinquished control of the site early the next morning, the 31 October, allowing access on to the site for HSE and the Agency to begin investigation of the incident.&lt;br&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;

These procedures should be linked to the procedures for pre-booking waste to be delivered to the site to ensure that designated storage areas, as marked on the site plan, are not exceeded&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;c) adequate instruction and supervision arrangements to ensure that the procedures and arrangements shown on the storage plan are implemented in practice&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;d) adequate arrangements for ensuring that laboratory smalls are separated into drums according to hazard category and that these drums are then stored appropriately according to that hazard (ie not all drums of lab smalls stored in the same place irrespective of hazard)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;e) adequate arrangements for the exclusion of all ignition sources from areas where flammable liquids are stored, including the installation of suitable electrical equipment which will not introduce an ignition risk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Failure to carry out a suitable risk assessment into the hazards and risks associated with the storage of dangerous substances in containers. The failings included:·&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;a) no consideration of specific substances or generic categories of hazard&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;b) inadequate consideration of storage arrangements&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;c) inadequate consideration of control measures to prevent any incident except for reliance on employees' intervention to prevent escalation of any incident&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;d) no consideration or comparison of applicable guidance&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;e) no specific consideration of laboratory smalls&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;f) segregation was not considered as a safeguard or preventive measure for the prevention of fire&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;g) assessment focuses on the personal safety of individual employees and does not adequately consider the risks of accidents that may cause harm to groups of persons or to persons outside the site boundary, or the risks to the environment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"Other":["Yes"]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["3de64cfa-1f90-d102-2a19-6138354596a3"],"Consequence_Description":["The Site Operator has estimated that the cost of the incident has been approx 5 million euros, of which 1.4 million are insured and 3.6 million uninsured. This includes both direct costs from the incident (site restoration, loss of business etc) and other costs as a result of findings from the investigation (including the disposal of radioactive materials found on the site and the investigation of unauthorised disposal of waste at the site).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to the costs above there are the fines and costs from the Court cases described below and the charges made under COMAH by HSE (of approximately 120,000 euros). This gives a figure of approximately 7 million euros. Also as a direct consequence of the incident the site never returned to operation and has now permanently closed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There were no on-site injuries or ill-health. Nine people were taken to hospital for examination on the day of the incident (believed to be 4 fire service personnel, one policeman, and four local residents) but none were detained in hospital. Subsequently numerous reports of illnesses to local residents have been reported. Direct linking of these reports to the incident&amp;nbsp; is unclear and is being investigated by the local health authority. None of the 17,500 tests carried out on over 500 environmental samples indicated any significant levels of contaminants off-site, although contaminated firewater run-offs is believed to have killed several hundred worms. The Environment Agency is continuing its' investigation into the long-term environmental effects. &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Environmental Monitoring&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A plume of smoke from the fire was driven by the high prevailing wind in a north, north-easterly direction over the village of Sandhurst.&amp;nbsp; No samples from the plume were obtained. Modelling work on the contents and the fate of the plume was commissioned as part of the legal investigation. The findings of this work are to be used with the human health study.&amp;nbsp; The Environment Agency and contractors undertook sampling of soil, water and air in and around the site.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This was targeted as much as possible to identify whether residents and their properties had been exposed to significant levels of harmful substances from the fire and the subsequent flooding events. Evidence of contamination on site and where firefighting run off water had collected was found.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; There was no evidence, from the media tested, to indicate that there had been widespread contamination off site at levels hazardous to health or the environment.&amp;nbsp; Results of property monitoring were provided to residents and all results are available from the Environment Agency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soil samples obtained in June 2001 showed no selenium or arsenic above the detection limit and contamination was restricted to elevated levels of phytotoxic metals (Lead Nickel and Copper) within the fire fighting wash water zone immediately adjacent to the site.&amp;nbsp; All other results were at background levels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A macro invertebrate survey of the Horn's ditch (which is adjacent to the site) in July 2001 revealed biological quality had marginally improved from a previous survey undertaken in 1996.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Horn's ditch was also electro-fished in July 2001 and found roach and eels to be present. There is no historic data available for this stretch; however the results are what would be expected for such a watercourse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A survey of teasels (a form of thistle) was undertaken in the locality. This indicated an atmospheric discharge of selenium did take place during the incident in an area close to the CSG site.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subsequent sampling of nearby pylons and new growth teasels, both proved negative for selenium.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In summary, the results of these surveys do not indicate any significant long term contamination and discussions will be undertaken with FSA, Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs and NFU to decide if further monitoring is appropriate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A precautionary pollution warning was issued to Severn Trent and Bristol Water but there was never considered to be a risk to drinking water abstraction as the Severn Trent abstraction is upstream of the incident. The flooding was preventing abstraction from the river Severn from taking place at the time of the incident and hence Bristol Water was also unaffected.&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Community Disruption:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The fire resulted in the Police evacuating approximately 60 local people at the time, who were allowed to return to their homes that evening, the 30 October. The evacuation itself was hampered by the fumes from the fire. 13 people sought medical advice (mostly emergency service personnel but including some local residents) although none required admission to hospital.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was significant off-site concern, with the formation of a local pressure group, campaigning primarily to stop the site re-opening; this was successful as the site did close down following the incident.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Media interest was also significant, in both local press (print &amp;amp; TV) and national (print &amp;amp; TV).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was much interest from the Local Member of Parliament with questions raised in Parliament and consequent interest by Ministers (a number of reports were prepared for the Deputy Prime Minister - details see C4c below).&lt;br&gt;"],"Human":[1],"Environmental":[0],"Cost":[1],"Disruption":[1]},"HumanOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"HumanOffSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","Effect":"Emergency Personnel : 13","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"DetailHumanOffSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Establishment total at risk","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"immediate fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"subsequent fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"hospitalizing injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other serious injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"health monitoring","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true}],"DetailHumanOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Establishment total at risk","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"immediate fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"subsequent fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"hospitalizing injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other serious injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"health monitoring","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true}],"DetailHumanEmergency":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Establishment total at risk","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"immediate fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"subsequent fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"hospitalizing injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other serious injuries","Quantity":13,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"health monitoring","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true}],"EnvironmentalOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"inland: metropolitan development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"inland: urban development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"inland: rural development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"inland: parkland/commonland","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"inland: grassland/pasture/meadow","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"inland: arable land/crops/vineyards/orchards","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"inland: woodland;
