This plant had been shut-down in June from 1 to 23. When it was started up problems were experienced in stabilizing the column and a number of repairs were made to the pumps and instrumentation. On the day of the explosion, the column was sufficiently stable. When the explosion occurred all the employees were by chance in the control room. No alarm signals sounded during the last 30 minutes before the explosion occurred except the general alarm that sounded a few seconds before. Despite of the difficult internal communication caused by the destruction of the internal telephone and alarm systems and the emergency control centre, the operators started to shut-down the other plants of the factory and to fight the fire. The external emergency services and the authorities were informed on the accident and the emergency plan for the Antwerp harbour was activated. The emergency services arrived on site in 10 minutes and with the help of the factory's operators put out the fire and the release of chemicals within half an hour. 13 operators (two of them were of an external factory working for BP Chemicals) and a person outside the establishment (working in a neighbouring factory) were slightly hurt. The most serious injury was a broken arm. There were considerable damages inside the establishment: the redistillation column (32 metres high and 2.3 metres in diameter) was completely destroyed and pieces were found up to 700 metres away, some in a neighbouring factory. The ethylene oxide plant and other nearby plants were seriously damaged. Most of the buildings in a radius of 300 metres were damaged. The internal alarm and telephone systems were damaged and could not be used. The emergency control room was also unusable. Outside the establishment, window panes were broken in neighbouring factories and the nearby village of Zwijndrecht (about 1 km away).
