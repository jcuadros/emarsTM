The accident caused an explosive fire, which was extinguished within half an hour. The accident took the lives of three peoples.&amp;nbsp; No-one was injured. The melt shop was in an annual maintenance shutdown and control work was being done on valves on the oxygen distribution pipeline. Main pipeline runs from the exterior of the building to the melt shop. The back-pressure valves had been changed and the testing of the system was starting up. The accident investigation has been carried out by the national Accident Investigation Board and TUKES. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Accident Case History&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A fierce fire costing the lives of three workers took place at the Tornio (Finland) steelworks of AvestaPolarit Stainless Oy on September 19, 2003. The accident site was the melting shop of the steelworks. The melting shop line number 2 that had been built the previous year was in its first annual maintenance shutdown. During the shutdown back pressure valves were to be installed to pipelines conveying the so called raw oxygen and pure oxygen. Therefore they had been closed and made purged by air. Most of the work had already been completed, and the foreman of the factory and the foreman of the subcontractor started preparing the&lt;br&gt;start-up of the oxygen systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The men entered the valve room on the third floor of the melting house, where they successfully opened the main shut valve of the raw oxygen line. Thereafter they started opening the main shut valve of the oxygen line. The valve was apparently stuck, because the bolt pin holding the hand wheel in the valve stem snapped. The men asked for pipe tongs, with the help of which they started turning the valve hand wheel stem. They managed to turn the stem about one turn, corresponding to a 9Â° turn of the disc. At that moment an explosive fire broke out. It kept burning fiercely as the oxygen was leaking from the damaged piping. Both the foremen that had been opening the valve and a welder who had come to the scene by chance were killed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Judging by the burn marks the fire started from the oxygen line main shut valve; a butterfly valve with a nominal diameter of 300 mm. Gaseous oxygen compressed to a pressure of 35 bar was flowing in the pipes. There was a by-pass line beside the valve. Due to safety reasons this line was supposed to be used to equalize the pressure on both sides of the main shut valve before opening the latter. After the accident the by-pass valve was found to be in a closed position, although no specific information about the use of the by-pass line was found in the investigation. Whether or not the by-pass line was used will have affected the cause of the fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to

When the valve was being opened, these two surfaces may have become hot by the friction and set fire to the plastic bearing material which ignites more easily than steel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) The valve may have been opened without equalising the pressure. In this case the dust particles from pipeline in the fast oxygen flow of the valve gap would have struck valve parts, become hot, and ignited the valve to burn in the oxygen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) A foreign object may have got stuck in the valve and formed a friction pair that caused friction heating when the valve was being opened. The third option is possible even though the by-pass line had been used, but the first two necessitate the opening of the valve without equalising the pressure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"],"Other":["Yes"]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","CauseType":{"Type_ID":1,"Category":"all","Description":"none"},"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","CauseType":{"Type_ID":1,"Category":"all","Description":"none"},"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","CauseType":{"Type_ID":1,"Category":"all","Description":"none"},"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","CauseType":{},"IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["b9640bbf-3250-4c3a-95af-c7428a3b2715"],"Consequence_Description":["&lt;p&gt;Three workers died in the accident.
