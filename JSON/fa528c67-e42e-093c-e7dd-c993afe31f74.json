In order to protect the control room of U 7000 and assure a perfect coverage (protection) of the area of the beach and the sea affected by the spillage, the foam was introduced for a long time in the rain water outfall.&lt;br&gt;At 23:45 the fire was declared extinguished and the situation was completely under control.&lt;br&gt;Due to the continuation of the foam injection, the end of the emergency was formally declared at 01:45 of 15/10/1998.&lt;br&gt;The seriously injured person was evacuated by the National Institute for Medical Emergencies to the Pedro Hispano Hospital and successively to the Unit for severe burns of the Coimbra University Hospital.&lt;br&gt;The body of the deceased person was removed after the legal formalities had been performed in presence of a representative of the state attorney's office and a representative of the municipal health authority; an autopsy was successively carried out on the body at the Institute for Legal Medicine of Porto.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Northern Marine Department was in charge of assessing and controlling the pollution; operations started at 07:00 on 15/10/1998 with the identification of the spots and terminated at 12:00 of the same day by using the following boats: Barra de Leixoes, Barra de Viana, Leao dos Mares. Only one small spot, having an extension of 100 m, was observed near the shore; the spot was thin and not very large and looked like diesel oil. No other spots were detected between the estuary of the Douro river and the area in front of Cabo Mundo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Official action taken - legal action: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Judicial investigation carried out by the state attorney&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Official action taken - other official action: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The General Direction of Energy withdrew the operation license of TOL (oil terminal)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Ministry of Economy created an investigation commission to define&amp;nbsp; exhaustively the responsibilities related to the accident. The final recommendations of the related report were the following:&lt;br&gt;Immediate actions&lt;br&gt;a) complete demolishing of the provisional drainage system up to 10\" gate valve connected to the 40\" diameter new pipeline.&lt;br&gt;b) Setting up and approval of detailed operational procedures, including the procedures for discharging clean or emulsified water, and foreseeing future situations in which a new hydrostatic test may be requested.&lt;br&gt;c) Development of more effective routines for verifying the technical capability of the tanker to control the pumping flow rates at any given time during discharge operations, if requested by the situation. &lt;br&gt;d) Definition of adequate routines for the documentation of the entire process of working out and authorising operational procedures or working instructions, respective discussion and familiarisation of the workers directly involved (documenting the operation), particularly for exceptional tasks.&lt;br&gt;e) Revoke the withdrawal of the operation license of the TOL (oil terminal), ordered in resolution No. 9/98 of Director General of Energy dated 15/10/1998, considering the necessity to operate TOL (the oil terminal) for supplying the refinery with raw materials; the analysis of the accident causes and all other elements collected during the investigation have clearly established that the operation of TOL (oil terminal) in normal condition does not represent any major risk (the successful unloading of the crude oil after the accident confirms it).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Medium term actions:&lt;br&gt;a) Planning of integrated measures for risk assessment inspections, carried out&amp;nbsp; by independent and competent authorities with the goal of assessing the integrity of the existing transfer installation for the crude oil unloaded for the refinery and the respective storage systems, and more specifically with regard to the respective state of corrosion.&lt;br&gt;b) Conclusion of the revision process of procedure DGRP 090.06/19994 - issue and approval&amp;nbsp; of study requests and execution of studies concerning specifically the adoption of appropriate methodologies for the evaluation of operational risks.&lt;br&gt;c) Realisation of an external safety audit of the procedures and processes of the Petrogal Refinery of Porto and publishing of the results.&lt;br&gt;d) Study and revision of the&amp;nbsp; framework for the initial and subsequent licensing procedures for similar installations, considering both the safety aspect and&amp;nbsp; the legal aspect, which normally foresees the appointment of a legal party responsible for collecting all advice involved and the initial definition of all parties to be consulted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Follow up and verification of the implementation of the actions&lt;br&gt;The Investigation Commission proposed the setting up of a follow-up commission,&amp;nbsp; with the participation of the Municipal&amp;nbsp; Chamber of Montesinhos, with the goal of monitoring the implementation of the recommended actions, and in particular of guaranteeing the population the safety conditions which legitimately can be expected from an industrial installation of this type.&lt;br&gt;Concerning the methodology to be adopted for the implementation, it was proposed to work out a report documenting the implementation of the recommended measures, directly under the responsibility of the Refinery Manager.&lt;br&gt;This report will have to document all the measures taken to eliminate the risk of the occurrence of similar accidents and discuss the degree of effectiveness of such measures and the possibility of maintaining them over time.&lt;br&gt;The report will have to contain at least:&lt;br&gt;- A review of the main and secondary hazard sources&lt;br&gt;- A review of all key factors or critical points identified, all preventive measures&amp;nbsp; taken, the degree of effectiveness of such measures and the possibility of maintaining them over time..&lt;br&gt;- A matrix listing the original recommendations, responsibilities for the implementation, and measures taken to comply with each recommendation. The matrix will also have to include any other measure requested by any other official authority, in the case of there being some.&lt;br&gt;The refinery shall present immediately to the licensing authority, within a period of not more than 8 days, a summary report of all accidents which involved the activation of the on-site emergency plan; this shall not interfere with&amp;nbsp; the works of the Follow-up Commission.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastUser":{"UserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"Name":["MINERVA"],"Surname":["Administrator"],"IsVisibleSensibleData":[false]},"LastDate":["2017-07-11T15:59:38.731"],"ParentCompany":{},"Region":{},"Province":{},"City":{},"PostCode":{},"Concurrency":[0]},"LockedUserId":{},"LockedDate":{},"IsLocked":[false],"IsLockedByMe":[false],"LockedUser":{}},"AccidentProfile_Tab":{"ReportingAuthority":{},"ContactPerson":{},"Reasons":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Substances involved: greater than 5% of quantity in Column 3 of Annex I"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Injury to persons: &gt;= 1 fatalities, &gt;= 6 hospitalizing injuries etc."},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Immediate damage to the environment (according to Annex VI)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Damage to property: on-site &gt;2M &amp;euro;, off-site &gt; 0.5M &amp;euro;"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"Cross-border damage: transboundary accidents"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"Interesting for lessons learned."}],"AffectedCountries":{}},"AccidentDescription_Tab":{"AccidentDescription":{"DominoEffects":[false],"NatechEvents":[false],"TransboundaryEffects":[false],"Contractors":[false],"accTypeRelease":[0],"accTypeFire":[0],"accTypeExplosion":[0],"accTypeTransport":[0],"accTypeOther":{},"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastDate":["2017-07-11T16:00:08.689"],"Concurrency":[0],"Translation":{"VersionId":["49bc1773-c432-aaa3-efb6-d00924535468"],"LanguageId":["EN"],"AccidentDescription":["Accidental spill of crude oil over a rain water drain, followed by a fire and an explosion in the Beach of Aterro near the refinery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the unloading operations of crude oil through the Ocean Terminal of Leixoes (OTL), operational instructions were issued and distributed on 13/10/1998.&lt;br&gt;The assistant manager of the logistics department and the manager of the Product Handling department worked out a document, dated 14/10/98, with the title \"Procedure for Setting the Pipeline under Pressure with Crude Oil\", concerning the operations of purging the soft water contained in the pipeline connecting the buoy with the refinery of Porto. The contents of the document remained known only to them. The document contained the pumping flow rate (ca. 500 m#/h), the volume of water to be purged (2900m#), the time estimated for purging the pipeline (ca. 6h), the frequency of supervisions of the system (in the first three hours not less than three times an hour; starting from the fourth hour continuous monitoring until conclusion of the purging), the circumstances for which the sewage treatment plant of the refinery would have to be contacted as well as the conditions under which the pumping operations would have to be stopped.&lt;br&gt;On 14/10/98 at about 20:30 h the deputy captain of the ship Enalios Tethis signed a discharge protocol, named \"Operation Agreement &amp;amp; Sequence Agreement\", according to the parameters agreed upon with the Product Handling department, without making any reservation from the part of the tanker concerning the assurance of minimal flow-rate of 500 m#/h .&lt;br&gt;Once the unloading started, the CLT informed the Product Handling control room that according to the information given by the ship, the pumping flow-rate corresponded to 300 m#/h.&lt;br&gt;The assistant manager of the Logistics department requested around 21:05 from- CLT an increase of the flow rate to 500 m#/h. He again requested the control room to confirm jointly with the CLT the flow rate, because the level in the channel was already reaching half level.&lt;br&gt;Around 21:15 the manager of the Product Handling Department communicated to the operator of the waste water treatment plant that the water which was being purged was clean, so that drain 25 (rainwater) could be diverted from the storm-water basin to the sea, an operation which was performed.&lt;br&gt;Around 21:20 the ship informed CLT that pumping was being carried out with a flow rate of 500m#/h , information which was transmitted to the control room of the Product Handling department.&lt;br&gt;Around 21:40 the assistant manager of the Logistics department requested an increase of the pumping flow rate of further 100 m3/h, having observed that in the purging zone (zona di spurgo) the water remained clean and that the level in the channel had increased to near to reach its maximum level; he also requested the CLT to confirm the flow rate. &lt;br&gt;Around 21:45 the deputy captain of the ship informed that the pumping was being carried out at a flow rate of 650 m#/h. After having established that the channel could not contain a higher flow rate, the assistant manager of the logistics department requested not to increase the flow rate any more and, in case of any variation, to reduce it. Instructions were issued to the ship not to exceed a flow rate of 700 m#/h.&lt;br&gt;During shift change at 22:00, the operation coordinator was informed about the situation and it was particularly recommended to him that \"if traces of oil appeared, to request U 7000 (on-site waste water treatment plant) to divert drain 25 to the storm water basins, and after 24:00 to divert the drain to the storm water basin in any case even if no oil spot appeared\".&lt;br&gt;The operator of the waste water treatment plant declared that at 22:30 he saw traces of hydrocarbons in the water flowing in the outlet box of drain 25 towards the rainwater drain; he then went to the storm water basins to ascertain the situation. &lt;br&gt;Around 22:40, he alerted by phone the control room of the Product Handling department and started the operations for diverting drain 25 from the rain water drain to the storm water basin of the waste water treatment plant. Meanwhile, the operator of the Security Service passing near the control room was requested to check what was occurring in drain 25.&lt;br&gt;At 22:45 the release of crude oil by drainage system 25 occurred.&lt;br&gt;In consideration of this situation, it was ordered to divert drain 25 towards the storm water basin and to contact CLT to stop the pumping from the ship.&lt;br&gt;At approx. 22:50 the operator of the waste water treatment plant performed the diverting operation of drain 25 from the rain water drain towards then storm water basins, but due to the high flow rate a part of the effluent was still discharged to the sea. It has not been determined if the operator acted following a specific order from the control room of the Product Handling department or if he acted on his own independent initiative. The operator declared that he acted on his own initiative. The Product Handling department declared on its side that a specific request had been issued.&lt;br&gt;Around 23:05, the Product Handling department requested CLT to interrupt the pumping, which was carried out. The Product Handling department informed CLT that the deputy captain had communicated that until 23:00 2900 m3 had been discharged.&lt;br&gt;Around 23:15 general alarm was released while the fire which had deflagrated on the beach of Aterro propagated through the rain water outfall to the rain water outlet box inside, the refinery .&lt;br&gt;The fire was declared extinguished at 23:45.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;
