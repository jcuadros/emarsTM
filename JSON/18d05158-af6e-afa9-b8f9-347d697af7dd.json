That build-up of pressure caused the bursting disk to burst, the safety valve to open and then the tank truck to split open. As the tank truck split open, the gas cloud which had been released via the safety valve was ignited. The force with which the tank truck split open caused other tank trucks nearby to move and some of them to be torn open, resulting in a pool fire. Account of events before the accident - On 25 February at 15:50 the processing of the product started. A temperature of 55 °C was then measured in the line from the truck to the furnace. The tank was delivered on 25 February at 10:00 and the delivery temperature was 35 °C. The aim was to start processing at 12:00, but this could not be done because the product was too viscous and the tank was warmed up with steam (6 bar - 160 °C). At 15:50 it was decided to try again to start the processing and from that time the temperature in the feedline was logged. The temperature in the tank itself was lower than the temperature measured in the feedline because the measurement was taken in the feedline to the furnace, where the product had been additionally warmed up through tracing. - On 26 February at around 10:00 (the steam (heating) to the tank was still on) it was noted that the N2 flow, press the tank empty, dropped, but the supply to the furnace remained the same. This indicated that a different mechanism (see below) was causing pressure in the tank. - On 26 February 2016 at around 11:00 the steam heating of the tank was stopped after inspecting it and checking the temperature gauge on the tank, which read 45° C at that moment. The log shows that at that moment the temperature in the feedline was 124 °C.\n- On 26 February between 11:30 and 12:00 there was a brief standstill in the direct injection owing to the normal operation of the incineration process in the oven itself. During that standstill the gas release outlet from the tank to the furnace was opened automatically because of high pressure in the tank. This was not noticed by the operators.\n- On 26 February at 12:00 the direct injection was started again. After that start N2 flow was no longer required in order to feed the furnace (the pressure in the tank itself was apparently sufficient). The feed flow to the furnace fluctuated a lot after the stoppage. This was possibly attributable to gas bubbles in the product being fed into the furnace. Those gas bubbles posed a problem for the flow gauge. Later on, the pressure built up more and more: The gas release outlet to the furnace was more and more open, the tank’s bursting disc and safety valve opened and finally the tank burst at 15:33. The operators present at the tank truck fled when the safety valve opened. Therefore nobody was injured.\n"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to

At higher temperatures a decomposition reaction takes place. For ACA itself that decomposition temperature is 157 °C, but for the waste flow it is lower. - The tank was heated with steam for 20 hours. During the inspection visit on 3 May 2016 the firm explained that the log showed that this was the first time that the heating on the tank itself stayed on for so long. There is no rule for tank heating time because this was not regarded as critical before the accident. It is a mere coincidence that on previous occasions the heating had never been on for so long. Although there is a concern to prevent blockages in the feedline to the furnace and therefore the heating is left on for long enough. The handling fiche for direct injection states that the tank should be additionally heated to 40 °C. This temperature should be checked during inspection rounds. This would show that the temperature measurement on the tank itself read 45 °C at the moment when the heating was turned off. - Calculations made by the firm show that, in view of the heating method (halfcoil connected to 6 bar steam), the heating period, the reduction of the quantity of product in the tank as a result of the feed and the properties of the product, it is possible that the temperature at which the decomposition reaction starts was in fact reached in the tank. Those calculations also took into account the product’s viscosity, which hampers heat transfer such that in places higher temperatures could be reached. - This information was not known to the firm before the accident and so no attention was paid to this aspect when the firm accepted the product for processing or when changes were made to the processing.\n"],"Other":[""]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment
