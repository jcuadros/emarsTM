The owner of the fireworks business is under investigation for multiple counts of manslaughter and criminal negligence resulting in a major accident. The plant area was ordered to be cordoned off. The plantâ€™s safety management system was audited in 2012, revealing major technical and management weaknesses with regard to safety issues. These weaknesses, with specific reference to health and safety for the protection of workers, were also highlighted by the local health authority following its inspection of safety conditions at the business.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The proceedings are ongoing and the expert witnesses appointed by the parties have not yet submitted their reports.&lt;/p&gt;"],"EmergencyResponce_Descr":["&lt;p&gt;The competent local fire brigade, ambulance service, carabinieri, municipal police, National Forestry Corps, military explosives experts and the main local authorities (regional and municipal authorities, Prefecture and prosecution service) got involved immediately. Given the nature and timing of the event, it would not have been feasible to manage the emergency internally. Local people who saw and felt the effects of the explosions called the fire brigade to report the accident and firefighters were promptly dispatched. The intervention basically consisted of searching for missing persons and putting out fires in vehicles and scrubland both on and off the plant premises, taking the necessary precautions given that unexploded fireworks were present. Once notified of the accident, the competent authority activated its External Emergency Plan.&amp;nbsp; As part of the activities carried out under this plan, inter-institutional meetings were held for a joint assessment of the event and to decide on further steps to be taken. Staff from the Prefecture took part in these meetings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At a dedicated meeting held on 10&amp;nbsp;July 2014 at the offices of the local authority, it was decided, in view of an assessment of the situation, that none of the additional measures possible under the External Emergency Plan would need to be activated, so the emergency was declared over.

The plant has a surface area of approximately 45&amp;nbsp;350&amp;nbsp;mÂ² and a wire mesh fence. It is located in a hilly area, on a slope that is not particularly steep. The nearest two populated areas are located approximately 1&amp;nbsp;km and 490&amp;nbsp;m away from the plant. There is railway and road infrastructure nearby (a state highway is approximately 1.8&amp;nbsp;km away and a railway line approximately 2.1&amp;nbsp;km), and the nearest railway station is approximately 2.5&amp;nbsp;km from the plant as the crow flies. There are no industrial premises, public offices, schools or hospitals within 1.0&amp;nbsp;km of the plant. There are production facilities around 2.2&amp;nbsp;km away, beyond the affected area for emergency planning purposes. None of the activities regulated by Council Directive 96/82/EC are present. An underground methane pipeline with a diameter of DN&amp;nbsp;150 runs along the local road that provides access to the plant (located to the east of the plant), and there is a 20&amp;nbsp;kV overhead power line at the plantâ€™s eastern boundary.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The operations carried out at the plant were as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Raw materials and/or semi-finished products were delivered and stored in suitable premises;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fireworks were manufactured by assembling pre-packaged components, namely coloured and/or explosive pyrotechnic mixtures, always hand-mixed and sealed in cardboard or polyethylene containers;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Finished products were dispatched.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The production and storage area used for the activities described consisted of nine buildings with different uses assigned to each, known as buildings A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H and I (figure 2), as well as a thermal power facility. The safety distances laid down in national legislation had been respected in the plantâ€™s design. Up to 21.5 tonnes of explosives in total could be kept in buildings A, B and G. A description of the plant and the maximum authorised product quantities is as follows:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Building A â€” storage of up to 1.5 tonnes of black powder of differing grain sizes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Building B (B1 and B2) â€” storage of up to 10 tonnes of explosive finished products (categories IV and V).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Building C (C1 and C2) â€” prepared explosive workshop and hydraulic press used to press small quantities of dampened black powder (a maximum of 500&amp;nbsp;g per cycle) into cardboard cartridges using special moulds. Reinforced concrete and bulletproof glass separated the press from the worker operating it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Building D â€” workshop and coloured blend warehouse. The â€” entirely manual â€” production work carried out in area D1 (where raw materials were blended together to produce the explosive mixture) concerned small amounts of material, producing mixture weighing between 2 and 10&amp;nbsp;kg. The materials originated in building F and the prepared mixtures were transported to building H. Area D2 contained a cement mixer, which was used to make up colour batches.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Building E â€” offices, canteen and service premises, located outside the fenced-off area in which explosives were manufactured and stored.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Building F (F1 and F2) â€” non-explosive raw material warehouse, with products separated into oxidising, flammable and combustible.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Building G (G1 and G2) â€” category-IV and -V explosive finished products warehouse, storing up to 10 tonnes of material. Both fireworks produced on-site and fireworks purchased from other factories for sale were stored here.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Building H â€” workshop used for preparing, finishing, filling and packaging fireworks.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Building I â€” canopy-covered milling facility. Inert materials were present in this area, which was used to blend coloured mixtures and dry the blends, as well as to house machinery.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;TPF â€” thermal power facility.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;According to the fire brigade, the firm also stored at the plant explosive material entrusted to it by the police for safekeeping after being seized; such material was being stored in the finished product warehouses (buildings B and G) at the time of the accident. The accident affected all the materials present on the plant premises.&amp;nbsp; The way the seized material was being stored does not seem to be linked to any of the explanations put forward for why the accident happened.&lt;/p&gt;"],"Installation_Description":["&lt;p&gt;According to the information available to date, the first explosion took place in building C, which houses the workshop used for prepared explosives and the hydraulic press, which was located in a dedicated area and used to press small quantities of dampened black powder (a maximum of 500&amp;nbsp;g per cycle) into cardboard cartridges using special moulds. Reinforced concrete and bulletproof glass separated the press from the worker operating it. Once the cartridges had been placed in the mould, they were filled with the dampened powder using a dispenser. The mould was then placed in the jaws of the press and, once the bulletproof safety glass separating the worker from the press had been lowered, subjected to a pressure of between 30 and 50 atmospheres for 2 seconds. Once the operation was finished, the cardboard cartridges containing the black powder would be placed on racks to dry.

To enable this, the plant has been cordoned off. According to the information received from the competent rescue units of the fire brigade, â€˜based on information obtained immediately after the event, it appears that work was taking place in the area housing the hydraulic press when the explosion took place, and a van was parked in the area opposite, presumably loaded with fireworks â€” it was completely destroyed in the accidentâ€™. According to the legal representative of the plant operator, with input from the expert witness, the explosion may have been caused by a spark generated by a discharge of electrostatic energy that had built up on a workerâ€™s clothing or on bags containing the raw materials awaiting processing in the hydraulic press area. It is argued that, given the fact that the accident took place at 13:40 in the month of July, the weather conditions (high temperature, low humidity) may have contributed to this accumulation of electrostatic energy.&amp;nbsp; The plantâ€™s representative has also stated that the surveillance footage from within the establishment shows that the first explosion took place in building C (workshop and hydraulic press) and that burning fragments (from finished fireworks present in the area) were launched in the direction of the other buildings reachable in a straight line from building C, causing a domino effect. The roofs of the affected buildings, which, in accordance with applicable legislation, had been designed to channel the force of the blast upwards in the event of an explosion inside, would not have been capable of protecting the products within those buildings from the impact of those burning fragments. The role, if any, of the van found destroyed in the area facing building C (figures 4 and 5 in the Confidential section) remains unclear, though it is â€˜very likely that it was directly affected by the explosion, since it marked one of the points of the crater and had been completely blown apart by the blastâ€™ (fire brigade report of 10&amp;nbsp;July 2014).&lt;/p&gt;"],"Other":["The procedure for ascertaining the causes and dynamics of the event is still ongoing.
