Measurements of chlorine concentrations in the atmosphere in effected areas of Spolana were taken by the fire services (8:45 LAO operation - 0.5 ppm, 8:55 Labe dock- 3 ppm). Measurements in the surroundings of the company were performed by EBS Spolana using a monitoring vehicle between 8:20 and 18:05. Measured concentrations of chlorine peaked at 0,6 mg/m3 (0.2 ppm). NES-OkU Melník also performed measurements in the surrounding towns between 9:25 and 11:40. The highest concentrations measured were 0.1 ppm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an attempt to limit the release of chlorine to the surroundings of building E 4990, the fire services installed water screens and used stable hasicí zarízení on the LAO plant. At 10:16 it was discovered that a brown liquid was flowing from the outflow of channel K1 to the River Labe. The fire services installed a scumboard wall. Visual control, analysis of samples and the short-term staining of the water confirmed that a large flow of water from the water screen had rinsed the sewerage system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order for the volume of leaking chlorine to be reduced Mr. Juris, after discussion with Mr. Fajkus and Mr. Kubista at around 9:00, decided to transfer the remaining content of tank 8 to tank 9 using the pressure of the chlorine. This however did not reduce the intensity of the chlorine leak. After approx. 60 min. the operation was stopped because the pressure in both of the tanks was presumed to be the same meaning extrusion would not continue. After 11:00 they attempted to limit the leakage by reverse air pressure to the delivery pipe of the pump and resulting back-pressure reduce the level of liquid chlorine in the delivery pipe, whereby improving the conditions under which the fire services were working to seal the leak. This was also to no avail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The activity of the fire services in building E 4990 was performed under extremely difficult circumstances (no light, whole storage area inundated in chlorine, liquid chlorine was spraying from the area of supposed leakage, freezing up of the lid). Contact with the chlorine caused damage to the protective clothing and gloves. It was necessary to regularly substitute fire services members in very short time intervals. Reinforcements were drafted from Melník, Neratovic and Kralup n/V. At 9:14 chlorine began to flow from the pipe in building E 4890, the fire services blocked the pipe at 9:38. The activity of the fire services inside building E 4990 on tank 8 was focused on plugging the supposed source of the leak using lead tape and quick-drying cement. Each attempt to stop the leak was unsuccessful until the pressure in the tank decreased at around 16:00, and it was discovered that the chlorine was leaking from the detached safety pipe of the feed conductor of the pump motor. The fire services finally stopped the leak by plugging the orifice of the detached safety pipe with a wooden peg, just before 17:00.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 17:05 the third degree chemical alarm was withdrawn at Spolana, subsequently NES-OkU Melník informed the residents in the surrounding towns. At 18:02 the second degree chemical alarm at the company was withdrawn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the accident and after stopping the leak several management meetings took place to plan the necessary and immediate measures to be taken for stopping the leak and restocking of auxiliary agents. Were decided and specified further methods and activities for the decontamination of building E 4990 and tank (securing the tank for removal of the residual chlorine, provision of chlorine cisterns, methods of inspection and control in object E 4990 and its surroundings). Immediate measures were put into place - until the cause of the accident in investigated the remaining liquid chlorine pumps must not be used in the storage area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Information on the accident was relayed to the media by the company's press officer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;26.7.2000 all the liquid chlorine was transferred from all of the tanks in building E4990 to the cistern. Decontamination of building E 4990, allowing entry to the building without the need for breathing apparatus was completed on 31.7.2000.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On 1.8.2000 the police department performed an inspection of the site in the presence of members of the company's investigative committee. A preliminary enquiry and photo documentation was taken at the site.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Decontamination of tank 8 was completed 8.8.2000. An internal inspection of the tank was performed and the pump was removed for inspection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Disassembly of the pump was performed and photo documentation was taken by the firm Neraservis in the presence of members of the committee on 9.8.2000.&lt;br&gt;"],"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastUser":{"UserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"Name":["MINERVA"],"Surname":["Administrator"],"IsVisibleSensibleData":[false]},"LastDate":["2017-07-11T15:59:38.729"],"ParentCompany":{},"Region":{},"Province":{},"City":{},"PostCode":{},"Concurrency":[0]},"LockedUserId":{},"LockedDate":{},"IsLocked":[false],"IsLockedByMe":[false],"LockedUser":{}},"AccidentProfile_Tab":{"ReportingAuthority":{},"ContactPerson":{},"Reasons":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Substances involved: greater than 5% of quantity in Column 3 of Annex I"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Injury to persons: &gt;= 1 fatalities, &gt;= 6 hospitalizing injuries etc."},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Immediate damage to the environment (according to Annex VI)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Damage to property: on-site &gt;2M &amp;euro;, off-site &gt; 0.5M &amp;euro;"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"Cross-border damage: transboundary accidents"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"Interesting for lessons learned."}],"AffectedCountries":{}},"AccidentDescription_Tab":{"AccidentDescription":{"DominoEffects":[false],"NatechEvents":[false],"TransboundaryEffects":[false],"Contractors":[false],"accTypeRelease":[0],"accTypeFire":[0],"accTypeExplosion":[0],"accTypeTransport":[0],"accTypeOther":{},"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastDate":["2017-07-11T16:00:08.688"],"Concurrency":[0],"Translation":{"VersionId":["151beaf1-bff9-c4bb-e1f0-961c949bdfc9"],"LanguageId":["EN"],"AccidentDescription":["Tubular protector on the electrical cable for the submerged pump in tank No. 8 was damaged during pumping thereby leading to a release of liquid chlorine from the tank.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On 21.7.2000 at 07:45 there was a release of chlorine to the atmosphere as a result of an operational accident involving the chlorine tank No. 8 (TK 2.01.C) in the chlorine store, building E 4990, in the electrolysis operations, PVC plant of the company. The release reached beyond the boundary of the company. At 07:56 h a level III chemical alarm was issued. The release from the tank was stopped before 17:00 h by the fire service in cooperation with workers from the electrolysis operation. During this time 12 members of HZS were treated medically, with 10 of these being injured (inhalation, acid burn). No other workers at the plant or inhabitants of the surrounding area were harmed. The accident had no affect on the operation of the production plants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the 21.7.2000 at 7:00 Mr Majer prepared, on the request of the head of the chlorine filling shop. Mr. Juris, the pumping of chlorine from tank 8 located in building E 4990 to an external tank. After performing the necessary manipulation and checking the operational parameters of the tank he switched on the pump in tank 8. At that point he heard a loud bang, and saw that the store was inundated with chlorine, whereby he switched off the pump. On the basis of the reaction of sensor no. 5 of the emergency monitoring system (a signal is lead to the electrolysis control panel of the operational headquarters of the fire services) at 7:49, it is possible to estimate the time of accident as approx. 7:45. Obrat informoval Mr. Juris and together dressed in protective masks they investigated what had happened. Due to the heavy inundation of chlorine Mr. Juris returned to the adjacent building for breathing equipment. He then informed Mr. Kubist, manager of the chlorine, lye and ATA production, who at 7:52 called for the fire services (extension 150). After entering the inundated storage area, Mr. Juris attempted to determine the source of the leakage. He discovered that the liquid chlorine was leaking from the top of tank 8, where the pump was located. He supposed that the chlorine delivery route from the pump was broken, as the leak occurred at the moment the pump was turned on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In difficult conditions and with minimal visibility he closed the armature of the delivery pump above the lid of the tank and opened the armature of the deaeration tank to the chlorine production. He then left the storage area and switched off the storage area ventilation system. In the meantime, Mr. Kubista activated the emergency shutdown in the sodium chloride production hall. The fire services arrived at 7:55 am. A third degree chemical alarm was sounded at 7:56 am. At this time wind direction was 278° (westerly) and velocity was 0.5 m/s. The fire services began their investigation at 8:00 am and began to take action to limit the leakage of chlorine from the tank. At the same time, Mr. Stastny switched off the electricity in building E 4990. The tenzometric scales and pressure and temperature measurements of the chlorine tanks in the store ceased to operate. After the arrival of the fire services, Mr. Juris and Mr. Kubista briefed them on the severity of the situation and that the liquid chlorine is probably leaking from the pump's feed pipe in tank 8. In light of the fact that after closing the delivery vent of the pump the intensity of the leak did not decrease, they deduced that the pipe ruptured somewhere between the lid of the tank and the delivery armature, where there is a special steel profile.. The fire services managed, under conditions of very poor visibility and spraying liquid chlorine, to directly identify the leakage point. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the basis of the third degree chemical alarm and the information given by NES -OkU Melník, vyhlásil NES the warning signal \"Catastrophe\" and subsequently announced that there had been a release of chlorine at Spolena over the public relay system in the town of Tisice-Kozly at 8:32. At 8:55 the announcement was made in the towns of Vsetaty, Ovcáry, Drísy and again in Tisice-Kozly. At 8:40 informoval VDO zdymadla Lobkovice and Obríství of the accident at Spolena and requested the closure of the River Labe (Elbe), which was reopened at 18:30. &lt;br&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;

Failure of pump motor in the tank.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The cause of the accident was a physical explosion in the electrical part of the pump due to a reaction between the copper conductors and the chlorine, initiated by sepnutí of the electrical circuit.&lt;br&gt;The explosion was preceded by penetration of liquid chlorine into the stator parts of the pump motor through a hole in the protective membrane of the stator with subsequent chemical degradation of the material and loss of the insulation properties of the conductors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A short-circuit occurred in the in the stator parts of the pump motor near the protective membrane, which was made of Hastelloa material, on the 20.7.2000, as a consequence of the loosening of several conductors, initiated by a chemical reaction with the chlorine. The protective membrane was exposed to high temperatures for a period of up to 12 seconds (time period until electrical protection reacted) and subsequently perforated. Then the electrical current was lost thereby shutting down the electrical protection. The reaction was subsequently inhibited by the impact of the presence of a large volume of liquid chlorine. Liquid chlorine entered the stator coil and protective tubing of the feed conductors through the perforation in the stator protective membrane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Due to the shutting down of the pump on the 21.7.2000 there was an electrical and temperature overload, caused by a spontaneous reaction between the copper conductors and the chlorine. The sharp increase in temperature and the subsequent pressure (approx. 70 - 100 MPa) caused the explosion. The speed of the explosion cancelled out the effectiveness of the electrical protection. The upper tube of the pump motor was lifted and with a slight delay caused a pressure shock and the energy of the released gaseous chlorine caused the horizontal parts of the tubing of the feed conductors to break. Analysis of the quality of the welded joint indicated a clean break, without material defect, fatigue or corrosive damage.&lt;br&gt;This resulted in the ejection of the remains of this tubing with the terminal block on the profile support of the flooring below the tank. The liquid chlorine then escaped from the tank to the collection sump no. 8.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;"],"Other":[""]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["151beaf1-bff9-c4bb-e1f0-961c949bdfc9"],"Consequence_Description":["Minor injuries to fire brigade members - 8 fire safety workers of Spolana a.s., 2 fire safety workers of Meln &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Off-site losses still under investigation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By 18.9.2000 there were a total of 12 demands for compensation of damages as a result of the accident (animal farming, forest and garden areas, loss of earnings) to the sum of approx. 75 mil.
