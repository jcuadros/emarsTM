The accident case history was as followed:&lt;br&gt;- 03:20 Production stopped.&lt;br&gt;- 04:00 Clearing of tank V-2500 (see diagram No 2 attached to the Original Report) from liquid chlorine (pumped into buffer tanks).&lt;br&gt;- 04:30 The remaining liquid chlorine in the heater section was (supposed to be) released to tank V-2504 (see diagram No 2). After the accident it was concluded that this step must have been executed in a too short period of time and only a partial boil-off of liquid chlorine resulted. So this section was still containing some liquid chlorine which was heated to about 80Â°C.&lt;br&gt;- 04:45 An attempt was made to free the heater section E-2504 (see diagram No 2) from (residual) chlorine by the introduction of pressurized air. The presence of a one-way valve may not have been recognized (see diagram No 2). It resulted in chlorine inlet into the process air system. Process air system (7 bara) was responsible for chlorine distribution and emission in about 12 different sites on the plant. Therefore, chlorine emission occurred via several in- and outdoors sources.&lt;br&gt;- 04:55 Chlorine detectors (limited to shipping and compression areas) intervened (chlorine concentrations up to 0.8 ppm during the accident) resulting in the automatic cut off of the equipment.&lt;br&gt;- 05:00 The air supply to the heater was manually closed (although the cause of chlorine leakage was not known, possible chlorine sources were blocked in). After, the remaining contents of the heater section was fed to a chlorine destruction unit.&lt;br&gt;- 05:25 Supervisor activated chlorine alarm (phase 0 according to the emergency plan: internal warning to personnel, external warning to local police).&lt;br&gt;- 06:00 Shift change (the night-crew remained several hours until the situation became clear). Due to the specific (weather and emission) conditions, there was no significant dispersion.&lt;br&gt;- 06:55 Supervisor activated chlorine alarm phase 1 (possible nuisance outside the plant).&lt;br&gt;- 07:30 Several complaints from the neighbourhood (about 10) recorded. Local police activated alarm phase 2 (annoyance, no danger).&lt;br&gt;- 07:45 Municipal fire brigade brought the alarm phase back to 1.
