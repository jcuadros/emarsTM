These modifications may be a source of triggering events (crystallisation and clogging in this case) and increased risk; -Even if events that seem insignificant in the smoot\nh running of the process such as the presence of glass debris from the lining of the distillation column coupled with the lack of a maintenance program on the production equipment (cleaning of the boiler) or safety equipment (clogging of the pressure sensor) do not directly lead to accidents, can have a considerable impact on the safety in downgraded modes; -a routine, unusual or exceptional maintenance operation (replacement of a pressure sensor) must be subject to a complete prior risk analysis, in order to avoid creating conditions which could lead to an accident or aggravate the initial consequences. In case of dangerous substances, these operations must be monitored and re-evaluated according to the hazards of the intervention; -the relative efficiency and the reliability of the procedures and more generally, organisational barriers (lock-out/lock-out removal); -a control system (steam valve) for a process can in no way be considered a safety system and cannot be retained as such. In particular, the production PLCs follow logic and criteria which the intervention teams are not fully aware of and which do not necessarily take the downgraded modes and lock-out situations into account. -the importance of installation design as early as the design phase (glass/metal interface); -the importance of risk analysis and failure modes, as well as technical and organisational barriers, with maximum details, for the various \"operating\" modes.\n"],"EmergencyResponce_Descr":["A safety alarm installed in the facility went off at 13.12 (giving a reading of 105 ppm of HCl).

The SCl2 hydrolysed upon contact with ambient humidity, causing an intensive emission of hydrogen chloride (HCl), which was not detected by the column's HCl gas detector (the threshold was at 25 ppm). A safety alarm installed in the facility went off at 13.12 (giving a reading of 105 ppm of HCl). The automated system shut down the facility and set off a local audible and visual alarm, while alarm warnings were appearing on the screens in the control room. The internal emergency plan was activated at 13.35, and the 35 employees were evacuated.

The retention basins were cleaned using a neutralising mixture (water + potassium carbonate), which was then pumped to the factory's treatment plant, where it was treated. A comparable accident took place at the site in 2006 (ARIA 31691).\nThe leak was caused by a mechanical rupture in the recirculating pump of a storage tank which had been filled 50 minutes earlier. This was aggravated by the non-closure of an automatic valve at the base of the tank, despite the fact that it had been activated, firstly by the safety controller when it was shut off, and then by the shut-off at the base of the tank at 13.30. A mechanical problem was the origin of the non-closure of the valve at the base of the tank; there had been difficulties closing this for the past 10 days. The authority for the inspection of classified installations notes that the pump's performance did not appear to be suited to its requirements, considering the large number of maintenance operations that it underwent prior to the accident. For his part, the operator countered that the pump's technology had functioned for more than 10 years without any signs of failure. In addition to having the pump and the valve assessed, the operator put the following measures in place:\n- The faulty pump and the valve at the base of the tank were replaced, as was the latter's actuator;\n- As a preventive measure, the weight indicators (weight sensors) of the damaged tank and that of the adjacent tank were replaced;\n- The cell of the HCl gas detector for the column was replaced and calibrated, as the malfunctioning of the existing detector, which had been checked 5 and a half months prior to the accident (the manufacturer recommends that this be done every 3 to 4 months) had not been remedied by re-calibration;\n- The valve at the base of each of the four SCl2 storage tanks was linked to the local HCl detection system;\n- Manual valves used to isolate the recirculating pump were automated and linked to the emergency shut-off system;\n- A drip tray was installed on the pump's leakage controller in order to prevent splashing from the retention tank.\n"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to

For his part, the operator countered that the pump's technology had functioned for more than 10 years without any signs of failure. In addition to having the pump and the valve assessed, the operator put the following measures in place:\n- The faulty pump and the valve at the base of the tank were replaced, as was the latter's actuator;\n- As a preventive measure, the weight indicators (weight sensors) of the damaged tank and that of the adjacent tank were replaced;\n- The cell of the HCl gas detector for the column was replaced and calibrated, as the malfunctioning of the existing detector, which had been checked 5 and a half months prior to the accident (the manufacturer recommends that this be done every 3 to 4 months) had not been remedied by re-calibration;\n- The valve at the base of each of the four SCl2 storage tanks was linked to the local HCl detection system;\n- Manual valves used to isolate the recirculating pump were automated and linked to the emergency shut-off system;\n- A drip tray was installed on the pump's leakage controller in order to prevent splashing from the retention tank.

The atmospheric hydrogen chloride measurements taken outside the site did not indicate any accidental pollution; only 50 ppm was recorded in the distillation column. The 150 m3 of water used by the water curtains deployed to neutralise the acid cloud was recovered (pH = 7), distilled and recycled in the process. Human consequences\nThe three employees who had entered the building during the operation had suffered from irritations and were thus hospitalised less than 24 hours. Activity and economic consequences\nThe activity downstream from the sulphur dichloride distillation operation, namely the synthesis of TB\nM6, was shut down for 18 days.
