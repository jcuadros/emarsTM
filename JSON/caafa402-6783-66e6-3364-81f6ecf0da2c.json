There were never less than 8 appliances on-site. Initially, a water mist curtain was put up to limit the diffusion of hydrogen chloride gas. After the fire started, foam was applied to the two process vessels to prevent their rupture. The southern half of the site had to be shut-down (except the sodium plant and the boiler house) and was evacuated for the duration of the fire and more extensive evacuation was considered but this was not necessary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:&lt;br&gt;The off-site emergency plan was activated. A nearby road was closed and two neighbouring premises were alerted in case evacuation became necessary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Emergency measures - Remarks: &lt;br&gt;2022 - flammable gas alarm sounded. &lt;br&gt;2026 - following investigation works emergency signalled. &lt;br&gt;2031 - work fire tender on scene. &lt;br&gt;2036 - major emergency declared and off-site help requested. Attempts by 2 employees to identify leak and enter gas cloud. &lt;br&gt;2047 - fire appliances arrived and set up a water curtain. 1 employee and 2 pairs of fire fighters on different occasions entered gas cloud at request of plant supervisor to close valves. &lt;br&gt;2125 - ignition. &lt;br&gt;2300 - major foam attack. - &lt;br&gt;2323 - possibility of complete evacuation of EC plant and alert to local authorities. &lt;br&gt;2350 - fire reduced to 2 main areas. &lt;br&gt;0100 - fire contained and under control. &lt;br&gt;0834 - fire extinguished. &lt;br&gt;1220 - small quantities of release finally stopped. &lt;br&gt;22 local authority fire appliances were used. The final 10 used to help transfer increased foam stocks required during major fire attack.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Official action taken - legal action: &lt;br&gt;Prosecution in Crown Court on 2.2.96 under section 2 and 3 Health &amp;amp; Safety at Work Act 1974 for endangering employees and others (principally fire fighters). Company fined a total of 150000 pounds with full costs of 142655 pounds awarded to HSE. The payment of full costs is now subject to an appeal by the company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Official action taken - other official action: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;3.2.94 Prohibition Notice (PN) issued prohibiting company from restarting production of ethyl chloride (EC) until it had demonstrated that \"the major accident hazards had been identified and that appropriate precautions had been taken to limit the consequences to persons and the environment\". \n4.2.94 Notice issued to leave plant undisturbed during investigation. Written notifications required to safety report because of change of working whilst EC plant closed, e.g. chlorine from electrolytic cells held in rail tankers. EC shipped in by boat and rail. \nWritten modifications to safety report required for new EC plant because of design changes. These were thoroughly assessed. Also changes to maintenance management procedures were required before the PN was considered complied with.\nThe PN was confirmed as complied with in December 1994 and the plant restarted in January 1995.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discussion about response:&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A published report will be available from 10 July 1996.
