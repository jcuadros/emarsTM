The supervisor on the day shift received the tank and attempted to connect it to the tank heating system over several hours. He failed to complete the work, leaving it to the the night shift. The night shift staff successfully completed this connection and applied heating. They next tried to connect the off-loading line through which a fresh nitrogen blanket was to be applied. This took time. They omitted to vent (depressurise) the tank as required during the period when the heating was applied, but were distracted by other problems. When going off shift, they left a verbal message to the day shift supervisor to vent the tank to depressurise it. This message was either not passed on, or ignored (accounts from the individuals conflict). The day shift supervisor did not vent the tank and tried to clear the blockage by inserting a heated metal rod in the discharge port to break the solid \"plug\" of sodium, resulting in the incident.

The worst possible effects of the cloud would have been mild irritation of eyes and mucous membranes. The operators asserted that an off-site emergency was declared as a precautionary measure (agreed by the emergency services). This involved radio announcements and information given to the local authority and significant retail developments. They also claimed that despite the inconvenience, the public preferred to have been warned of the incident rather than have been left in ignorance with an obvious cloud approaching them. They stated that this attitude was confirmed at subsequent community liaison meetings. Some residents expressed concern to the Member of Parliament for the local constituency and these have been discussed with the Competent Authority (HSE), as a a result of which a local COMAH liaison committee has been established involving all relevant stakeholders including COMAH establishments, emergency services, local community and Competent Authorities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The off-loading building was destroyed but no other physical damage sustained to other parts of the establishment. Effects on the establishment were confined to disruption during the incident, when fire figting, subsequent loss of use of the destroyed plant, and management time taken in responding to the community and Competent Authorities. Off-site effects were short-term disruption in response to the major hazard alarm, confinement of members of the public for the duration of the incident, and short-term closure of a nearby motorway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Affected Area: installation&lt;br&gt;Affected Area: establishment&lt;br&gt;Affected Area: off-site: local&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"Human":[1],"Environmental":[0],"Cost":[1],"Disruption":[1]},"HumanOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","Effect":"Establishment Population: 98","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"HumanOffSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","Effect":"Emergency Personnel : 80 OffSite Population : 2000","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"DetailHumanOffSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Establishment total at risk","Quantity":2000,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"immediate fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"subsequent fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"hospitalizing injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other serious injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"health monitoring","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true}],"DetailHumanOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Establishment total at risk","Quantity":98,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"immediate fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"subsequent fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"hospitalizing injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other serious injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"health monitoring","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true}],"DetailHumanEmergency":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Establishment total at risk","Quantity":80,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"immediate fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"subsequent fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"hospitalizing injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other serious injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"health monitoring","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true}],"EnvironmentalOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"inland: metropolitan development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"inland: urban development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"inland: rural development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"inland: parkland/commonland","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"inland: grassland/pasture/meadow","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"inland: arable land/crops/vineyards/orchards","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"inland: woodland;
