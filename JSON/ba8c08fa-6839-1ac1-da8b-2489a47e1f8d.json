The absence of automatic systems highlighted the fact that it was impossible to activate manually the relevant devices, as they were not accessible, being located in the immediate proximity of the flames rather than outside the building. Wherever the sprinkling valves could be activated quickly, the stocks were protected and the fire prevented.&lt;br&gt;    &lt;br&gt;Particular attention should be given to hazardous substances (distribution, storage and traceability), to the capacity for quick and automatic response in case of an accident, to the creation of emulsifier stocks (sufficient quantities), to the preparation of retention ponds which are adequately sized for the extinguishing water in case of a fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although the incapacity to retain the extinguishing water appears to have had no consequences, it has become the subject of intense considerations which aim to find solutions that can be applied also to all other establishments of the same type.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moreover, in the light of the results of the technical inquiry being carried out in relation to the accident, corrective measures have been prescribed. Generally speaking, a risk assessment and an evaluation of the prevention measures have been undertaken (updating of the hazard studies, consideration of possible domino effects, possible third party expert evaluations).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"EmergencyResponce_Descr":["After detection of the fire the on-site fire brigade made an initial attempt to extinguish the fire which was unsuccessful, the fire brigade of the nearby city alerted for support arrived rapidly. The off-site fire brigade requested reinforcement from other fire-brigades in neighbouring cities and departments (regions), once confronted with the rapid spread of the fire. A total of 500 firemen were involved in the emergency response operations with a peak of 130 firemen simultaneously.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The favourable environmental conditions for the dispersion of the smoke cloud associated with the absence strong wind were favourable to the emergency response operations and have permitted to avoid spreading the fire to adjoining buildings. In fact an important assembling shop and a research laboratory adjoining the building are of a fundamental importance for the operation of the site and of the company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Large amounts of emulsifiers were needed for the fire fighting operations, in fact of 100.000 litres of emulsifiers requisitioned i the Auvergne region 80.000 were used for the fire-fighting operations. An analysis of the amounts of water used estimates that 90.000 m3 of extinguishing water were used during operation to extinguish the fire, a third of which were used by the sprinkling systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While during the fire and in the following weeks, attention in the press was primarily drawn on the large smoke cloud which could be observed during extinguishing operations, actions taken by the public authorities and DRIRE have taken all possible hazards into account as soon as the accident happened.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It should be noted, however, that the facility does not present elements making any major hazard as likely  (absence of a significant inventory of toxic products, easily flammable products or explosive substances, etc.).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;"],"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastUser":{"UserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"Name":["MINERVA"],"Surname":["Administrator"],"IsVisibleSensibleData":[false]},"LastDate":["2017-07-11T15:59:38.73"],"ParentCompany":{},"Region":{},"Province":{},"City":{},"PostCode":{},"Concurrency":[0]},"LockedUserId":{},"LockedDate":{},"IsLocked":[false],"IsLockedByMe":[false],"LockedUser":{}},"AccidentProfile_Tab":{"ReportingAuthority":{},"ContactPerson":{},"Reasons":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Substances involved: greater than 5% of quantity in Column 3 of Annex I"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Injury to persons: &gt;= 1 fatalities, &gt;= 6 hospitalizing injuries etc."},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Immediate damage to the environment (according to Annex VI)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Damage to property: on-site &gt;2M &amp;euro;, off-site &gt; 0.5M &amp;euro;"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"Cross-border damage: transboundary accidents"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"Interesting for lessons learned."}],"AffectedCountries":{}},"AccidentDescription_Tab":{"AccidentDescription":{"DominoEffects":[false],"NatechEvents":[false],"TransboundaryEffects":[false],"Contractors":[true],"accTypeRelease":[0],"accTypeFire":[0],"accTypeExplosion":[0],"accTypeTransport":[0],"accTypeOther":{},"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastDate":["2017-07-11T16:00:08.689"],"Concurrency":[0],"Translation":{"VersionId":["c184d72b-1517-eecf-2bea-f90ed9912027"],"LanguageId":["EN"],"AccidentDescription":["A fire devastated a part of a plant where rubber-like materials are produced and used.

Most part of the damaged building will have to be demolished. 1.415 tonnes of gum were affected by the fire. The only important machine present in the building, an automatic weight-dosing machine (MAC BU), separated from the fire by a wall, and the majority of the chemical products were protected by the firemen and not damaged. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The economic consequences were relatively limited. Only the buffer stocks of raw materials and a large portion of building O24 were destroyed. No essential installation was affected. Technical unemployment was not  considered and the MAC BU machine was rapidly placed back into service.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the beginning of the occurrence it was possible to state that, in all likelihood, the nature of the materials involved  into the combustion process would present limited toxic hazards, although the size of the fire and the incomplete combustion would cause a spectacular smoke plume rich in unburned particles (soot).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fire department  performed a few basic air quality tests, in the immediate proximity of the fire, without detecting toxic compounds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ATMO network for the air quality monitoring of the Auvergne region did not detect any dramatic increases of air pollutants. The air quality remained below thresholds over the urban area. However, there were numerous requests for information. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The real-time measurements starting from January 21st, 2000, &lt;br&gt;- the mobile laboratory of the ATMO network set-up along the axis followed by the smoke cloud, &lt;br&gt;- and additional measurements, on dust and particle fallout, performed by an approved organisation over the following weeks,&lt;br&gt;confirmed that at the highest pollution peak, the concentrations of dust in the ambient air, outside the smoke cloud, remained much below the average daily exposition threshold recommended by WHO.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All measurements data gathered until now confirm that the cloud caused a few temporary increases of dust and sulphur dioxide concentrations. Particle fallout remained very localised. The values measured remained below concentrations which can occur during unfavourable meteorological conditions for the dispersion of urban pollutants- thermal inversion anticyclonic period #&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No major impact was measured during or after the fire (death to fish, plant life, etc.). Afterwards, large monitoring campaigns have been carried out in order to analyse and evaluate non visible effects. The results are detailed in the paragraph \"Actions taken\". &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Long and complex analyses were also carried out on the sediments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"Human":[1],"Environmental":[1],"Cost":[1],"Disruption":[0]},"HumanOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","Effect":"members of the on-site fire-brigade ","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"HumanOffSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"At risk","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Fatalities","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Injuries","Quantity":9,"Effect":"members of the off-site fire-brigades","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Other","IsChecked":false}],"DetailHumanOffSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Establishment total at risk","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"immediate fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"subsequent fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"hospitalizing injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other serious injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"health monitoring","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true}],"DetailHumanOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Establishment total at risk","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"immediate fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"subsequent fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"hospitalizing injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other serious injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"health monitoring","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true}],"DetailHumanEmergency":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Establishment total at risk","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"immediate fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"subsequent fatalities","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"hospitalizing injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other serious injuries","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"health monitoring","Quantity":0,"IsChecked":true}],"EnvironmentalOnSite":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"inland: metropolitan development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"inland: urban development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"inland: rural development","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"inland: parkland/commonland","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"inland: grassland/pasture/meadow","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"inland: arable land/crops/vineyards/orchards","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"inland: woodland;
