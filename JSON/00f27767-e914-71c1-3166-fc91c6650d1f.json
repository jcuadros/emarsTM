One worker suffered serious burns during the incident. The fire caused extensive damage to the facility, in particular to the electrical cables and data communication. According to statements made by the plant manager, material damage amounted to about €3 million to €4 million. The investigation found that the incident was caused by unforeseen excess pressure in a preparation tank for a radical initiator.\nDuring a filling procedure, AIBN was released in the form of a dust cloud, which then ignited, injuring the employee working in the area. A second deflagration occurred when three open AIBN drums, which were near the reactor, ignited. This second deflagration was stronger than the first, and caused the extensive damage to cables and an electrical room. When the process control system activated the alarm, the system was shut down to put it in a safe condition. All input of material ceased, and the remaining reaction heat in the reactor was removed as quickly as possible using water in the cooling circuit.\nWithin about 30 minutes the remaining initiator was used up, polymerisation stopped and the reactor cooled to room temperature. Sequence of events:\n19 October 2011\nFollowing a stoppage, the reactor was put back into operation and approximately 400 litres of AMS/ACN solution was poured in to seal the output pumps. Various problems with the ACN intake valves, as well other system valves, led to operation being suspended so that the intake system could be examined.\nIt was subsequently established that the problems were caused by a faulty software update to the DCS system. As a result, the software update was repeated without further problems. The software error itself is not considered to be the cause or a contributing aspect of the incident. 23 October 2011\n13.30: For the current production in the reactor, a new starting solution was created; the system was working normally, with no signs of any anomalies. 20.13: The shift workers determined that the reactor (due to the above problem of the inoperative intake system) was showing a pressure of 3 bars. A manual valve was opened to release pressure from the tank into the emergency release tank.\nThe shift workers were not aware, nor could they have noticed, that releasing pressure from the reactor led to a pressure build-up in the emergency release tank.\nA subsequent calculation of the pressure patterns showed that the decrease in pressure in the reactor from 3 bars at 20.14 to 2.1 bars at 21.03 led to an increase in pressure in the emergency release tank from 1 bar to 1.7 bars at the time of the incident. Approx. 20.25: The growing pressure in the emergency release tank reached 1.2 bars, causing the white oil contained in the immersion tank to be pushed into the preparation tank.\nThis assumption was confirmed by analyses of the contents of the preparation tank after the incident, which revealed the presence of white oil. Furthermore, in the gas phase of the preparation tank, organic compounds (acrylonitrile) were detected. This shows that the gas phases of the emergency release tank and of the preparation tank were connected and at the same pressure level at this time. The pressure in this combined system continued to grow to 1.7 bars at the time of the incident. Approx. 20.30: A worker left the measuring station to prepare the next batch of AIBN starting solution to be added to the preparation tank. He removed four drums of AIBN from storage and placed them on a trolley, removed all four lids and placed the first drum in the drum tipper. This was normal procedure. Approx. 20.50: The first drum was swung over the preparation tank and the slide valve on the tank was opened. As the second slide valve opened, a dust cloud issued from the funnel of the drum tipper, ignited and injured the worker, who at that point was standing at the drum tipper’s control panel. A reconstruction of this situation shows that, when the second slide valve on the drum was opened, the excess pressure of 1.7 bars in the preparation tank lifted the drum out of the funnel by at least a few centimetres. The excess pressure blew the powdered AIBN out of the drum and into the surrounding area, leading to a dust cloud, which subsequently ignited. This ignition could have happened one of two ways:\na) A brush discharge onto metal parts can lead to ignition of the mixture of AIBN powder and the gas phase containing organic components, or\nb) Ignition caused by brush discharge onto the inner lining of the drum.\nBoth possibilities could arise from the drum being lifted up by the excess pressure and the resulting gap between the drum and the funnel, if a highly charged dust cloud with a high gas velocity issues from the gap. 21.03: The shift workers at the measuring station heard an explosion and saw multiple gas detector alerts on their screens. In front of the measuring station, they found the injured worker, who was wet from the emergency shower when he came into the measuring station. They noticed a large fire in the area of the drum tipper and immediately alerted the fire service and the emergency doctor.\nBecause of the fire and the damage done to the cables, most of the DCS information was cut off.\nThe investigation after the incident showed that the injured worker had most likely opened all four drums and left the lids on a shelf on the wall.\nThe drum, which had been swung over the preparation tank, exhibited a large hole and was empty, and the metal rings of the other drums were found near the trolley that had been used to transport the drums from storage to the drum tipper. It is clear that, a couple of minutes after the first fire occurred, the fire caused by the dust cloud had ignited the other three drums (this was the explosion heard by the shift workers) and the cables on the wall behind the drums. 21.11: The on-site fire service fought the fire; all other persons evacuated the building.\nThe cables on the wall bracket led to the central electrical room, behind the wall and one floor up. Some of the cables passed through the wall through sand traps, which were fire resistant, while others led to the electrical room through Hauff cable ducts with insufficient fire resistance. 21.36: Fire under control, worker on way to specialist clinic. 22.40: Fire extinguished, although the on-site fire service posted a fire watch until the next morning.\n"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to

Creation of the AIBN dust cloud with subsequent ignition:\nWhen relieving the pressure in the reactor by opening the manual valve, the shift workers were not aware that that could overload the gas system of the emergency release tank. The occurrence of excess pressure in the preparation tank caused by opening a manual valve had not been taken into account in safety discussions, only excess pressure caused by the activation of safety valves had been considered; however, this should have become apparent due to the abnormal conditions in the polymerisation reactors.\nThis approach was also supported by technology experts. This problem was made worse by a process modification in 2008, when the exhaust gas line of the preparation tank was attached to the emergency release tank, i.e. before the perforated disk in the exhaust system leading to the vent pipe. In addition, the pressure indicators on the preparation tank were installed such that the shift worker could not see them when operating the drum tipper.\nA HAZOP study was carried out on the polymerisation process; however, the preparation tank for the initiator was not taken into consideration, as it was not seen to entail a risk (due in part to the conclusion that excess pressure would be noticeable due to a disturbance in the polymerisation tank).\nThe recommendation was made to carry out a HAZOP study on the AIBN system when it is put back into operation. 2. Second deflagration and the larger fire with resulting damage to cables and electrical room:\nBecause all four AIBN drums were positioned and opened near the drum tipper, the first fire caused by the dust igniting was able to ignite a larger amount of flammable material, and the fire therefore became significantly bigger. Furthermore, the cable fire reached the electrical room through the Hauff cable ducts. The damage to the cables and in the electrical room meant that the facility was completely out of operation for longer.\nThe decision to include the Hauff system in the factory standard, with reference to the on-site fire service, should be re-examined in light of this incident. 3. The seriousness of the shift worker’s burns:\nThe worker was wearing normal work clothing which was seen as appropriate to the activities.\nIn light of this incident and the seriousness of the injuries he suffered because of it, the protective equipment for this activity and for the site must undergo a full review.\n"],"Other":[""]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment
