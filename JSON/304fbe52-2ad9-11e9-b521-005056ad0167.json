Ca. 4000 tonnes of Vale SAS where piled up in the warehouse. After taking contact with the owner of the product, the pile was cooled down with water. The advice given by the owner&amp;nbsp;of the product was not to distribute the pile of powder over a larger area by the wheel loaders but to just cool it with large amounts of water. Friday evening a technician saw smoke coming from the pile again and again the advice was to cool the product with water. The technician monitored the situation during the advised period of time and when the situation was considered to be under control, the technician left the premises.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The owner of the product wrote down in the SDS that it was strictly forbidden to cool the product with water, but that it has to be distributed by a wheel loader. A few hours later the advice changed from distribution by a wheel loeader to extinguishing and cooling with large amounts of water. This cooling with large amounts of water was done by purpose of stopping the chemical reaction. There has never been a direct beam of water on the smouldering fire.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning 11th August 2018 at 10 a.m. a large amount of smoke was seen by another technician and by a contractor who were present because they had to start construction works. They were only present for this construction work since the company doesn't operate in the weekend. They immediately contacted the emergency services. The fire brigade came to the scene and in consultation with the owner of the product, the fire brigade decided to distribute the product by wheel loaders in a layer of limited hight over the surface. Saturday evening while still spreading the product a larger pocket of smouldering product was found. By excavating this smouldering product, the smouldering fire intensified which made it impossible to further work with theel loaders in the warehouse. The fire brigade desided not to follow the earlier advise not to use water any more and started to extinguish the smouldering fire with water, shortly after midnight.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Due to the toxic (SO2) smoke from the fire, a wide area around the company was evacuated. Several neighbouring companies had to shut down due to this evacuation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The fire brigade stayed on the premises till&amp;nbsp;noon on 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; August . They have extinguished the fire with large amounts of fire water. The water in the warehouse and in the drain was sucked into vacuum trucks after the fire was extinguished and was brought to the owner of the product for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A part of the dock was sealed by putting an oil containment boom in one corner. At the surface of the water were floating a number of yellow ‘plugs’, who were sucked and transported to the owner of the product for further analysis.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The contained water which was collected in the dirty water tank was treated by the company itself. The dirty water tank was filled for about 85% after the incident.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Because of the extent of the incident comprising 4000 ton environmentally dangerous product, this incident is to be considered a major accident according to the Seveso legislation.&lt;/p&gt;"],"TypeOther":{}}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;
