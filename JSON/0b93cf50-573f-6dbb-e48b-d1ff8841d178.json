Description of the situation prior to the accident:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 8.1.2006 - technology shutdown of HCN and cyanide production. At the time the AKH production was not in operation, DPG production was in normal operation as was the pumping of wastewater from the hydraulic barrier. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Only wastewater from the DPG and hydraulic barrier was lead to the WWTP - detoxication sump. In order to clean the equipment on 8.1.2006 the cyanide production equipment remained shutdown. Once the WWTP (chemical) container was filled, the wastewater was pumped to the WWTP - detoxication sump for further treatment. Monitoring of the detoxication sump is done both by a floating gauge that signals that the sump is full and by visual inspection by service staff. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The night shift 8/9.1.2006 - according to the staff working on the night shift no variation from the normal operation was noted after shutting down the HCN and cyanide production. During the night the temperature dropped from approx. 13°C to -15°C. Due to the fact that water leaking during shutdown of production is much more concentrated, pretreatment was performed on detoxication sump 3 which was unsuccessful. A responsible staff member was made aware of this by telephone at approx 11 o'clock pm. He decided to fill the sump and that treatment would be performed on the morning shift. In the second half of the shift no employees were working in the vicinity of the sumps neither were the sumps visually inspected. Employees left the plant at 6 o'clock am.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Temporal course of the accident in the area of the WWTP - detoxication sump at LZD and subsequent action taken:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 9.1.2006 the detoxication sump WWTP was found to be completely full in the early hours; a responsible employee determined that there was no overflow from the sump. Responsible employee who filled the sump took these immediate measures:&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In conformity with the working instruction PI 1201-16-02; point 5.1 (deviation from the normal technological regime) a submerged pump was used to pump the content of sump 3 (full sump) to sump 2 to reduce its volume.&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The equipment was checked to determine why there was no signal that the sump was full. It was determined that the floating signal gauge was frozen (due to the low temperatures during the night). The indicator of the gauge was freed manually and the gauge immediately began to operate with no problem.&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The concentration of the discharged water was checked and found not to exceed the limit values.&lt;br&gt;After taking these measures he checked the other parts of the WWTP and chemical WWTP. On his return he realized that the pump hose was pulled out of the side of the sump. On first inspection no water was flowing from the hose and nothing indicated that any water had escaped from the sump. Therefore he did not evaluate the situation at this time as an accident and did not report anything to his superiors. This information only came to light in his statement dated 10.2.2006.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 12.1.2006 (in the early hours) - service staff at the Podebrady and Nymburk dams informed the water management control center of the Labe river catchment authorities of considerable fish fatalities near the hydraulic power station. The police, CIZP, and the local fishery unions in Podebrady and Nymburk were informed immediately. Analysis of the dead fish determined an accidental degradation of water quality caused by an unknown material, which was subsequently determined to be total cyanide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 13.1.2006 (Friday) - CIZP performed an inspection at LZD in order to determine the possibility of a release of cyanide. After a local investigation they determined that the presence of cyanide in the Labe could have originated at LZD. The CIZP hypothesis stated that most probably an overflow of the detoxication sump occurred and water was released through the company's sewerage system to the Labe.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 16.1.2006 (Monday) - an internal committee was set up to determine:&lt;br&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Whether or not the ecological accident was caused by contaminated water from LZD&lt;br&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The actual cause of the accident&lt;br&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The temporal course of the accident&lt;br&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Effective remedial measures&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 16.1.2006 - technical equipment was inspected at the WWTP - detoxication sump to determine the possible cause of the accident. From the first information given by staff on the morning shift it was determined that during the change of shifts on 9.1. detoxication sump 3 was found to be completely full whereby they pumped part of the contents and that they subsequently found the signal gauge to be frozen and fixed this problem. There was no mention at this stage that the pump hose was found beside the sump. Based on this information the floating signal gauge was checked and was taken into consideration during the investigation of the occurrence and causes of the accident, and relevant remedial measures were taken i.e. increase in frequency of physical inspection in the area of discharge of wastewater from LZD.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. 16.1.2006 - CIZP performed another inspection where further details of the accident came to light including the measures taken to avoid a repeat of the accident. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 16.1.2006 - considering the local investigation performed together with CIZP and the information given by staff of the morning shift the Commission stated that on the 9.1.2006 there was most probably an accident at LZD involving a release of an undefined volume of discharge water to the Labe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;7.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 16.1-17.12006 - based on point 6 remediation of the surroundings of the WWTP - detoxication sump was performed including measures to limit release to the sewerage system. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;8.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 17.1.2006 - LZD presented its statement at a press conference that based on internal investigation and the conclusion of CIZP an accident occurred on 9.1.2006 which led to the release of wastewater with an undefined content of cyanide to the Labe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;9.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 17.1.2006 - LZD announced a major accident pursuant to Article 15 paragraph 2 of Act 353/1999 Coll. to the relevant state administration within the legal deadline (i.e. within 24 hours of determining an accident occurred).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;10.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 19.1.2006 - first negotiations between LZD and the local fishery unions on compensation for damages caused by the accident.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;11.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 20.1.2006 - a report was submitted to CIZP on remedial measures to be taken and their deadlines for elaboration. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;12.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 23.1.2006 - internal guidelines (organization regulations) were issued at LZD to improve controls and record keeping of the discharge of wastewater and to establish further measures to be taken to solve issues of wastewater discharge at LZD.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;13.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;24.1.2006 - Doc. Ing. Jan Chysky CSc. was commissioned to elaborate an expert opinion on the situation and the possible causes of the malfunction of the floating signalization gauge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;14.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 26.1.2006 - Doc. Ing. Jan Chysky CSc. submits his expert opinion to LZD.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;15.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 27.1.2006 - CIZP issued a report on the fulfillment of remedial measures set by CIZP.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;16.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;27.1.2006 - CIZP issued with the expert opinion on the malfunction of the floating signalization gauge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;17.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 27.1.2006 - meeting between LZD and the Labe River Catchment Authority at which the accident was reviewed and proposals for further steps to be taken and cooperation between the two bodies were made.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;18.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 31.1.2006 - LZD and the fisheries sign an agreement of financial compensation for losses caused by the accident.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;19.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 27.1.2006 - 16.2.2006 - based on the conclusions of Doc. Ing. Jan Chysky CSc. and the information on total cyanide contamination in the river (taken from Labe River Catchment Authority reports) it was determined that the malfunction of the gauge could not be the only cause of the accident. For this reason and based on further investigation, the internal Committee came to the conclusion that human error was to some extent involved in the accident.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;20.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 10.2.2006 - internal investigation with staff members of energy production and in particular those who were preset on the night and morning shifts prior to and during the accident. This resulted in the opinions of individual employees on the course of the shifts prior to and during the accident. In particular Mr. Charamzy (WWTP - sump service staff member), Mr. Krutsky (WWTP - sump supervisor) and Mr. Soukup (head of energy production). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;21.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 17.2.2006 - on the basis of the results of the internal investigation the general manager was informed of the possible causes of the accident by an internal memo which stated that several human errors occurred during the accident, including:&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The WWTP sump specialist - supervisor did not correctly evaluate the state of the detoxication sumps during the night shift or organize the activity of the service staff,&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The WWTP sump specialist - supervisor acted carelessly during pumping of the detoxication sump,&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The WWTP sump specialist - supervisor poorly evaluated the situation&amp;nbsp; from the point of view of the possible release of toxic water and accident occurrence and did not inform his subordinates,&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The WWTP sump specialist - supervisor did not divulge all of the facts important in determining the causes of the accident during the first internal investigation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;22.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 21.2.2006 - LZD informed the public at a press conference that based on the internal investigation it was determined that other than the technical malfunction, human error was also to blame for the accident.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Remedial measures taken after discovery of accident:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The following measures were taken at LZD after the accident of 9.1.2006 (adopted in cooperation with CIZP):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Immediate measures taken after determining the accident:&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The rainwater sewerage system was shut down in the area of the WWTP - detoxication sump and the sewerage system was temporarily insulated with a VAPO pneumatic filling. When the climatic conditions improve the outlet will be concreted. Concreting was performed in the second half of 2006.&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Signalization system was improved with doubling the amount of floating signalization gauges&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Physical checks of the working of the floating signalization gauges at the beginning of each shift change were initiated.&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Expert opinion on the analysis of the state of the signalization gauge in sump 3 was commissioned with emphasis on the possible technical malfunction on 9.1.2006.&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Frequency of visual checks on filling of detoxication sumps increased to once per hour at least for each sump.&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Above-ground supply pipes were checked for integrity of joints.&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Pump hoses were changed and an overall inspection of pumps used in the WWTP - detoxication sump was performed.&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Frequency of analyses of discharged wastewater from LZD outlets increased, specifically for presence of cyanide min. once every 2 hours on specific objects. &lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The system for control and recording of wastewater discharge from the detoxication sumps was changed. New internal guideline OP VR 13 - 06 - \"control of discharged wastewater from the detoxication sump WWTP\" was elaborated, which sets the scope and method of record keeping of wastewater discharge, in particular it sets the responsibility for responsible people to give signed permission for the discharge of the sumps.&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Training and testing of all service staff of the detoxication sumps on their knowledge of internal technological guidelines related to their employment was performed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The following measures were not taken immediately or could not be taken immediately:&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Rapid construction of new chemical-biological WWTP with deadline to be in pilot operation 31.10.2006 at the latest.&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Evaluation of the current capacity of the WWTP - detoxication sumps&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Issuing of internal memo to inform all employees of set limits for wastewater discharge from LZD for CN- tox and CN- total.&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Directive of the general manager issued at the managerial meeting 23.1.2006, \"During non-standard behavior of technology or disposal of waste of any type limit or completely stop production and together with relevant responsible person determine the situation\".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to fulfill the long-term and short-term measures the following tasks were accepted in the minutes from operational meeting no. 4 dated 23.1.2006:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; verify production technology in areas where a release of hazardous compounds to the environment may occur and up-date or change documentation in order to reduce the volume o hazardous compounds and the risk of release &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Deadline for fulfillment of task: 30.6.2006&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Completion: task is completed, responsible person ing.

To-date, only one administrative procedure had been completed (KUSK) for not having insurance cover for major accidents. The other administrative procedures are not yet complete. These will be made known when complete by responsible members of the management without delay. The results of the administrative procedures will be made known to the employees in the local press. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- During non-standard behavior of technology or disposal of waste of any type limit or completely stop production and together with relevant responsible person determine the situation.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Deadline for completing task:&amp;nbsp; constant&lt;br&gt;Completion of task: task fulfilled constantly, the relevant employees are fully informed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. Evaluation of the actions of LZD employees during the accident, verification of operative processes of employees and their compliance with the law and LZD internal guidelines:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Description of the WWTP - detoxication sump&lt;br&gt;Wastewater from the production of AKH and DPG are lead to the detoxication sump from the hydraulic barrier and wastewater with a high content of CN ions for rinsing of cyanide production equipment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Under normal operational conditions the following average daily volumes are lead to the WWTP - detoxication sumps:&lt;br&gt;from DPG production &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 100 - 120 m3&lt;br&gt;from AKH production and HCN&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 30 - 35&amp;nbsp; m3&lt;br&gt;from Hydraulic barrier&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 10 - 15&amp;nbsp; m3&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wastewater from the production of HCN and NaCN are lead to the chemical WWTP, which treats water with high content of CN ions. &lt;br&gt;Toxic water in the WWTP-detoxication sump usually has toxic levels ranging in the hundreds of mg CN-/l.&lt;br&gt;The total capacity of the detoxication sumps under normal operational conditions is 250 m3 (40% of which is suspension). This volume guarantees sufficient wastewater containment for detoxication. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In exceptional cases (malfunction of the striper, malfunction in the production of cyanide, shut down of HCN or cyanide production) the WWTP-detoxication sump is used for disposal of wastewater from the cyanide production or HCN. This wastewater is more toxic with values can range in the thousands of mg CN-/l. The volume of wastewater that can be lead to the detoxication-WWTP is given by the method of treatment and retention of the individual apparatus for the production of HCN and cyanide, and ranges in (max.) tens of m3.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Description of the activities of service staff at the WWTP - detoxication sump&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The internal guidelines PI 1201-16-02 \"Detoxication sump\" and TR 1201-04-02&amp;nbsp; \"Detoxication sump\" were issued for operation of the technology. Employees are made familiarly with theses internal guidelines which are constantly made available and are obliged to follow them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wastewater discharge is recorded on the form \"summery of pumped sumps, volumes of wastewater and consumption of raw materials\". The detoxication process and results of analytical evaluation are written on the operational sheet \"Detoxication sump (pumping, treatment)\". &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apart from during the main shift, analytical evaluation is performed at the weekends and during unmanned shifts by the water management laboratories at LZD. During the main shift analytical evaluation is performed during inter-operational controls. The results are recorded in the relevant laboratory logs and on the operation sheet \"Detoxication sump (pumping, treatment)\". &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Technological regulation in Chapter 7.1. Deviations from the normal technological regime includes the procedure during treatment and discharge of wastewater for possible very alkaline water, large volumes of cyanide ions and in the case that the wastewater can no be treated using the standard methods. In this case it is permitted to pump the wastewater over a longer period of time in order to reach the required limit concentrations. The values of contamination in the discharged wastewater from the LZD site in indicator CN ions (toxic and total) are set by a valid permit issued by the relevant water management authority, which is the environmental and agriculture department of the regional office of the central Bohemian region. The permit was issued 17.8.2004 and is valid to 31.12.2006.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Values for wastewater discharged from the LZD site are as follows:&lt;br&gt;- CNtox&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 3 mg/l&lt;br&gt;- CNtotal&amp;nbsp; 10 mg/l&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All activities were performed by the service staff during the accident of the 9.1.2006 according to the above-mentioned technological documentation. The only error of the service staff was to not secure the pumping hose and to not pay adequate attention during pumping. On the other hand though, the WWTP - detoxication sump is not an area that is permanently manned i.e. staff members perform other duties in conformity with their work responsibilities, the WWTP - detoxication sump therefore is not constantly manned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another error of service staff was to not inform superiors or investigators of the accident of the hose that was pulled out and lying on the edge of the sump.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. Conclusion:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the basis of the internal investigation of committee the following conclusions have been made:&lt;br&gt;The accident of 9.1.2006 occurred due to several factors. The low temperatures had a negative effect on the formation of nontoxic forms of cyanide and on the floating signalization gauge.&amp;nbsp; This however was not the main cause of the accident. &lt;br&gt;The Commission states that the service staff of the WWTP - detoxication sump in essence acted in conformity with valid internal guidelines, even though the accident occurred, whose cause was the carelessness of service staff, and in particular:&lt;br&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; insufficient securing or no securing at all of pump hose during pumping wastewater from sump 3 to sump 2. &lt;br&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; carelessness during pumping of wastewater from sump 3 to sump 2, and not discovering that the pump hose on the edge of the sump was extracted, which was most probably the cause of the release of toxic wastewater to the company's sewerage system and subsequently to the Labe.&lt;br&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; not informing subordinates of the extracted pump hose on the edge of the sump, and subsequently not informing management during the investigation of the accident.&lt;br&gt;Criminal responsibility of service staff flowing from the above mentioned errors is in the full competence of the authorities acting in legal procedures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After evaluating the adopted measures, both immediate and subsequent, the Commission states that the scope of these measures was and is adequate for the occurrence of an emergency situation and that all measures are duly fulfilled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Done in Kolin 31.3.2006&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Signatures of Committee Members:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Ing.
