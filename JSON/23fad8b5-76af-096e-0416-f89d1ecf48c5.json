The fire spread rapidly and violently, involving within minutes an external drum storage area where flammable liquids were stored. The fire took considerable resources and time to extinguish. During fire, two explosions occurred in the warehouse. Off-site damages were significant and a large number of residents were evacuated from their houses.

The rapidity of spread of the fire was due to a breakdown in good chemical warehousing practices in the factory which led to materials which were incompatible in a fire being stored together.
