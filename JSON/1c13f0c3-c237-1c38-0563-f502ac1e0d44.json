These include not giving appropriate attention to the matter of external safety (at least where professional fireworks are concerned), not following up on lessons learned from an earlier fireworks explosion (Culemborg, 1991), inaccessibility of regulations and information on the subject, lack of communication between the official organisation and the politically responsible administrators and lack of supervision and enforcement. These issues have received a lot of political attention.

The area was evacuated for 3 days, the area in the near surroundings is still evacuated. A team of specialists has come to the area to identify the deaths. From the very beginning of the rescue operations, German rescue services assisted the Dutch rescue services. An independent board for accident investigation is being formed to investigate the cause of the accident (they also take into account: legislation, governmental services, permits, regulatory bodies, emergency measures taken, audits, procedures etc.). Decontamination (asbestos, personal safety equipment). The municipality provided psychological help, financial support and new housing for the people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Emergency measures - Remarks: &lt;br&gt;Around 15.00 reports of fire near the Grolsch brewery reached the police. At 15.03 the police arrived at the site, fire brigade followed at 15.08 and the first ambulance arrived at 15.16. By now a large crowd of spectators was assembling, attracted by the spectacle of the exploding fireworks. Police and ambulance personnel decided to keep the public at distance and, with some difficulty, managed to clear the Tollensstraat. Shortly afterwards, at 15.36 the final explosion took place. The fire brigade suffered heavy losses: 4 fire men were missing, several more were injured and all of their equipment was destroyed. As a result hardly any attempts to extinguish the fires were made during the first 40 minutes after the explosions. The many small fires in the area developed into an sea of fire. During the next hours contingency plans were set into action. Fire brigades and medical assistance were called in from other parts of the country and Germany. The last fires were put out on May 15, 02.00. Emergency facilities for the treatment of wounded and shelters for people who lost their houses were organised. The search and registration for missing persons was organised. Arrangements have been made to compensate the victims for their material losses. Psychological follow-up care is still being provided.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seveso II duties  - remarks: &lt;br&gt;\nWritten safety\nregulations had been made available to all employees. These included a\nsmoking prohibition, regulations for wearing cotton clothing,\nregulations for handling boxes of firework during loading and\nunloading, check on the use of personal protection devices and the use\nof fire extinguishers. Nearly all employees had followed specific\ntraining for working with fireworks.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Official action taken - legal action: &lt;br&gt;Public prosecution started a penal investigation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Official action taken - other official action: &lt;br&gt;A special committee (Committee Oosting) has been installed to investigate the disaster. The committee presented its report on February 28, 2001.&lt;br&gt;Assisted by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports (VWS) a Centre for Information and Advice (Informatie- en Adviescentrum) was set up shortly after the disaster, and measures have been taken concerning medical and psycho-social after-care. &lt;br&gt;The Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and Environment (VROM) was involved in soil decontamination, demolition of buildings and removal of asbestos&lt;br&gt;The Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment (SZW) was involved in three financial emergency arrangements in the week after the disaster for occupants involved.&lt;br&gt;The government gave an advance to the city Enschede to cover additional expenses. Also, funds have been added to the budgets of several departments (total amount DFL 92,1 million).&lt;br&gt;Eight state inspections have conducted an investigation, final reports were presented on January 15, 2001.&lt;br&gt;Four state inspections have conducted an investigation into the follow-up of the fireworks explosion in Culemborg in 1991. These reports were presented on February 19, 2001.&lt;br&gt;In the third week of June, all mayors involved were informed of locations of munitions depots by the Ministry of Defence in consultation with VROM.&lt;br&gt;On June 26, 2000, the Court of Mayor and Aldermen of Enschede have installed the Committee Financial Settlements (Commissie Financiële Afwikkeling). Arrangements for private persons and companies were presented in September and November 2000. &lt;br&gt;VROM took the initiative to construct a directive on fireworks. The concept directive was published on February 26, 2001.&lt;br&gt;On July 27, 2000 VROM presented an inventory of fireworks companies in The Netherlands &lt;br&gt;Between July and October 2000, the external safety of munitions depots was inventoried by the Environmental Hygiene Inspection &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastUser":{"UserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"Name":["MINERVA"],"Surname":["Administrator"],"IsVisibleSensibleData":[false]},"LastDate":["2017-07-11T15:59:38.731"],"ParentCompany":{},"Region":{},"Province":{},"City":{},"PostCode":{},"Concurrency":[0]},"LockedUserId":{},"LockedDate":{},"IsLocked":[false],"IsLockedByMe":[false],"LockedUser":{}},"AccidentProfile_Tab":{"ReportingAuthority":{},"ContactPerson":{},"Reasons":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Substances involved: greater than 5% of quantity in Column 3 of Annex I"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Injury to persons: &gt;= 1 fatalities, &gt;= 6 hospitalizing injuries etc."},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Immediate damage to the environment (according to Annex VI)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Damage to property: on-site &gt;2M &amp;euro;, off-site &gt; 0.5M &amp;euro;"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"Cross-border damage: transboundary accidents"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"Interesting for lessons learned."}],"AffectedCountries":{}},"AccidentDescription_Tab":{"AccidentDescription":{"DominoEffects":[false],"NatechEvents":[false],"TransboundaryEffects":[false],"Contractors":[false],"accTypeRelease":[0],"accTypeFire":[0],"accTypeExplosion":[0],"accTypeTransport":[0],"accTypeOther":{},"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastDate":["2017-07-11T16:00:08.689"],"Concurrency":[0],"Translation":{"VersionId":["57b4ed1c-a4f4-b206-8642-bd1a7b2ad9e3"],"LanguageId":["EN"],"AccidentDescription":["The accident started with a fire. 3 Explosions occurred. Water contamination cannot be excluded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A fire started in the repackaging area. The fire jumped across to other storage rooms and eventually caused a mass explosion of the stored fireworks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The process of escalation that lead to the disaster started in the repackaging area C2. The cause of the initial fire in this area has not been clarified. Suggested causes are: arson, auto-ignition of a so-called flash-cord, short circuiting of an improvised electricity conduit in C2 or the (illegal) handling/using of fireworks on May 13. The fire was not noticed until external effects occurred. When the fire brigade arrived at the scene, the fire had probably been going on for at least 25 minutes. By that time several fires had started in the area, caused by ejected fireworks. At a certain point in time, a fire started in a triangle between two containers and the concrete fencing of the site. Even after the fire in C2 was brought under control, smoke and later flames and ignited fireworks were detected from the adjacent bunker C4. A suggested scenario how the fire spread to this bunker is that it passed through the 7 centimeter diameter water-pipe lead-through in the wall between C2 and C4. Consequently, the fire brigade detected the fire in the triangle between the two containers (E2 and E15) and the concrete fence. Attempts to extinguish this fire were complicated by the inaccessability of the triangle. At this moment the fire had probably already spread to the contents of container E2. This may be concluded from the fact that shortly after the fire brigade had started extinguishing the fire in the triangle, they observed signs of fire in container E2. Shortly afterwards, container E2 exploded. This explosion caused a large flame in the direction of the central storage. However, this has probably not been the main factor in the following escalation. Ejected heavy fireworks from E2 exploded in front of the MAVO boxes, probably struck through the doors of these boxes and ignited its contents. Within one minute after the explosion of container E2, the MAVO boxes exploded rapidly one by one, starting with M7. This mass explosion is probably mainly due to the heavy class of the fireworks, in combination with the small dampening between the MAVO boxes. M7 probably contained fireworks of class 1.1. Its explosion had a TNT equivalent of circa 800 kg and was accompanied by a shock wave and a fire ball of 85 meters in diameter. Little more than a minute after the explosion of the MAVO boxes the final explosion took place, destroying bunker C11 and the rest of the bunker complex. The remaining containers exploded almost simultaneously. It is assumed that the ejected fireworks from the explosion of the MAVO boxes and/or the fireball initiated the explosion in C11. The doors of the bunkers had probably been destroyed by the previous explosion. The explosion of the other bunkers of the central storage was either initiated by ejected fireworks, or by the heat from the explosion in C11. The time interval between the explosions of the separate bunkers was so small that they were perceived as one. This final explosion had a TNT-equivalent of about 4 to 5 tonnes.&lt;br&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;

The company stored more fireworks than it had obtained permits for, and the majority of these fireworks were of a much heavier class than was permitted. Fireworks were present in the repackaging area where the fire first started, in which area no fireworks were permitted to be present when no work was being performed, as was the case on May 13. The water-pipe lead-through between the repackaging area and the adjacent bunker C4 was of a nature which allowed fire to jump across. Two containers with no permits had been added in 1999, one of these two containers (E15) formed a side of the triangle in which fireworks ejected from the repackaging area and/or the adjacent bunker started a fire. That triangle was, due to the way in which this container had been positioned, nearly closed off and difficult to access. The part of the terrain in this triangle had not been kept sufficiently clean to prevent the fire from spreading.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"Other":["Yes"]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","IsChecked":true},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["57b4ed1c-a4f4-b206-8642-bd1a7b2ad9e3"],"Consequence_Description":["Area concerned - Remarks: &lt;br&gt;\nThe surroundings of the\nsite were divided into two sections: the so-called inner ring counted\n4163 inhabitants. The outer ring counted 5724 inhabitants.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;People - Remarks: &lt;br&gt;18 people (among who 4 of the 24 firemen at he site) were killed instantly, 3 persons were reported missing. Five months later another victim died in hospital. It is assumed that the missing persons also died in the disaster. 947 people were registered as being injured, 527 of them were treated in hospital. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ecological harm - Remarks: &lt;br&gt;Several hours after the explosion measurements of relevant substances (including asbestos) were started. Measurements were repeated over the following two weeks. The results show that the maximum daily intake for human exposure has not been exceeded for nearly every relevant dangerous substance in air. Health monitoring of victims and emergency personnel show no consistent elevation of dangerous substances in blood and urine samples. It is therefore assumed that environment and public health have not been endangered by exposure to dangerous substances after the explosion.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;National heritage loss - Remarks: &lt;br&gt;National Museum Twenthe was damaged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Material loss - Remarks: &lt;br&gt;Total material costs are estimated to be at least 1.000.000.000 guilders. 1250 persons have lost their houses. A number of them also lost all of their possessions. About 10,000 people were forced to spend at least one night elsewhere.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Disruption of community life: &lt;br&gt;Communication networks were overheated for several hours after the explosion. 400 houses are demolished or severely damaged.
