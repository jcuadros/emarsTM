Greater than 5% of the qualifying quantity of a dangerous\nsubstance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Comments: The establishment is a COMAH Lower-Tier site, which is wholly contained within a COMAH Top-Tier site.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meteorological conditions - Remarks: &lt;/b&gt;Other than above, conditions were dry, frosty and still. The ambient temperature caused solidification of the lost inventory within the bund with no immediate risk to people or environment.&lt;br&gt;Wind speed: 1.00, Wind direction: North West, Wind stability: A, Temperature: 5.00&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discussion about the Occurrence&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;The plant had two phenol stock tanks; a larger storage tank (40 tonnes capacity) and a smaller process feed stock tank (18 tonnes capacity). The larger stock tank received road tanker deliveries and phenol needed for the process was transferred to the smaller tank in 12 tonne lots. Process phenol was then continuously circulated between the manufacturing plant and the smaller tank. The level in each tank was measured by load cells informing high weight alarms on the control panel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shortly after a tanker delivery, the smaller (18 tonne) tank was topped up and the transfer system was set by an operator to circulate phenol for the process. However, the circulation was incorrectly set. This resulted in the closure of the smaller tank outlet and the pumping of phenol from the larger storage tank to the plant and then back into the smaller tank, which gradually overflowed into the bund. As the top-up had just been done, the panel operators had acknowledged a high weight alarm and did not spot the over-filling until the tank overflowed into the bund around it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The operator wrongly positioned valving which set the system up to take phenol from the larger storage tank, circulate it to the manufacturing plant and back into the smaller tank. The outlet of the latter had been closed hence it gradually filled up and passed out of the overflow into the bund.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Had the pump mode been correctly selected for transferring to the manufacturing plant, the limt switch on the&amp;nbsp; larger storage tank outlet valve would have been enabled and would have prevented the transfer pump operating, but&amp;nbsp; the pump mode was incorrectly set, by-passing this interlock.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since level measurement relied on load cells, the panel operators' understanding of plant status was flawed. Just prior to the incident phenol had been transferred from the larger storage tank to the smaller (from which the manufacturing plant was supplied). The high weight alarm had been used to judge when sufficient phenol had been transferred and the alarm had been acknowledged. Not enough phenol had been used up by the manufacturing process for the weight in the smaller tank to drop and hence for the alarm to reset. Thus as the smaller tank was filling up the panel operators did not notice it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The investigation found that the mix of automated and manual systems for controlling the pump mode, switching and valve settings was vulnerable to human error.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The establishment is a COMAH Lower-Tier site, which is wholly contained within a COMAH Top-Tier site.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;

Process phenol was then continuously circulated between the manufacturing plant and the smaller tank. The level in each tank was measured by load cells informing high weight alarms on the control panel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Valving was changed manually.

The pump setting control was in the plant control room.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Setting the pump mode for offloading (South mode) enabled the larger tank alarm and disabled that on the smaller tank. Setting the pump for transfer to the smaller tank (North mode) switched the enabling of the weight alarms and enabled limit switches on the larger&amp;nbsp; tank outlet and the tanker offloading valves which prevented pump operation when these valves were open. Setting the pump for transfer to the process plant (Auto mode) disabled both high weight alarms and the limit switches on the 40 tonne tank outlet and tanker valves.

However, the circulation was incorrectly set. This resulted in the closure of the smaller tank outlet and the pumping of phenol from the larger storage tank to the plant and then back into the smaller tank, which gradually overflowed into the bund. As the top-up had just been done, the panel operators had acknowledged a high weight alarm and did not spot the over-filling until the tank overflowed into the bund around it.\n\nThe investigation found that the mix of automated and manual systems for controlling the pump mode, switching and valve settings was vulnerable to human error.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Poor design of safeguards relying on indirect measurement of level in storage tanks and manual intervention to correctly position both valving and pump mode (the latter from a remote location) left the system vulnerable to human error.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/b&gt;The establishment is a\nCOMAH Lower-Tier site, which is wholly contained within a COMAH\nTop-Tier site. The COMAH Lower-Tier operator engages the staff of its\nhost COMAH Top-Tier operator to run the plant to the host's operating\nenvironmental and safety management procedures. The host site's\nemergency procedures were applied to the incident and dealt with it\nwithout problem. This operator's MAPP addresses the issues around the\nincident, but the operating procedures were not sufficiently explicit,\nas there was no system for avoiding human error and the hardware safety\nsystems were easy to defeat.
