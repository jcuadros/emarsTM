This leads to the hypothesis of a breach of safety requirements with regard to the maximum quantities of dangerous substances kept in store and processed; it should be stressed that the safety distances laid down in the National regulations are valid and upheld only if obligations stemming from them and from safety requirements and safety procedures are also systematically complied with; attention should be drawn to the company's deficient in-house management of the emergency, including its failure to call in the emergency services in good time and failure to detect situations requiring the immediate evacuation of the premises: the failure to evacuate staff from the premises after the initial explosions aggravated the damage caused; as for the damage caused by the ejection of debris, attention should be drawn to the lethal effect of the pieces produced by the break up of the roof of shed No&amp;nbsp;8 which, thanks to their strong but thin metal structure (sandwich panels), when ejected at high speed following the shock wave acted like sharp blades, thus causing the death of one employee. Consequently, the technical issue of the construction features of the roofs on the sheds, also raised in discussions with a police bomb expert, should be noted: although this type of roof is adequate in terms of providing protection and a preferential vent for a shed containing explosive material, it may aggravate the effects of an explosion in the shed in which it is broken into fragments; with regard to the difficulty of emergency service and fire service action during the explosions, it is noted that the presence of a second access route to the works, on the opposite side to the first access route, would have facilitated the positioning of fire-fighting equipment and the management of the emergency response and would significantly have reduced the fire-fighting team's risk of exposure to the shock wave and material debris during the operation. In this connection, the effective coordination of the team, with the fire-fighting units positioned and arranged in such a way as to take advantage the protection offered by the variations in altitude of the terrain on which the sheds were located, and the team's use of PPE (safety helmets, etc.) undoubtedly prevented the situation becoming more costly in terms of damage suffered by the fire-fighters.&lt;/p&gt;"],"EmergencyResponce_Descr":["&lt;p&gt;Considering the dynamics of the accident, the effects, and the information provided by the firefighters teams involved in the emergency procedure, it is possible to say that the internal emergency plan was not really activated, and the external emergency was not adequately and quickly requested by the company. Firefighters were called first only by the citizens of surrounding towns, after seeing and hearing explosion effects. In fact, the local firefighters chief reported that it received one call from a survivor component of the company only after 8 calls of citizens. Moreover, after the first explosions, the missing evacuation of the surviving operators inside the plant led to increase the damages.&lt;/p&gt;"],"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["6799492a-0079-4d05-aad1-8f4dce857337"],"LastUser":{"UserId":["6799492a-0079-4d05-aad1-8f4dce857337"],"Name":["Enrico"],"Surname":["GUAGNINI"],"IsVisibleSensibleData":[false]},"LastDate":["2019-03-20T12:38:09.977"],"ParentCompany":{},"Region":{},"Province":{},"City":{},"PostCode":{},"Concurrency":[0]},"LockedUserId":{},"LockedDate":{},"IsLocked":[false],"IsLockedByMe":[false],"LockedUser":{}},"AccidentProfile_Tab":{"ReportingAuthority":{},"ContactPerson":{},"Reasons":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Substances involved: greater than 5% of quantity in Column 3 of Annex I"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Injury to persons: &gt;= 1 fatalities, &gt;= 6 hospitalizing injuries etc."},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Immediate damage to the environment (according to Annex VI)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Damage to property: on-site &gt;2M &amp;euro;, off-site &gt; 0.5M &amp;euro;"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"Cross-border damage: transboundary accidents"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"Interesting for lessons learned."}],"AffectedCountries":{}},"AccidentDescription_Tab":{"AccidentDescription":{"DominoEffects":[true],"NatechEvents":[false],"TransboundaryEffects":[false],"Contractors":[false],"accTypeRelease":[0],"accTypeFire":[0],"accTypeExplosion":[0],"accTypeTransport":[0],"accTypeOther":{},"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["6799492a-0079-4d05-aad1-8f4dce857337"],"LastDate":["2019-03-20T12:38:09.977"],"Concurrency":[0],"Translation":{"VersionId":["3ce3a35a-63f0-4225-9efd-06dc9fe9305f"],"LanguageId":["EN"],"AccidentDescription":["&lt;p&gt;At 10.15 a.m. on the morning of 25&amp;nbsp;July 2013, a series of explosions occurred in the finished products storage area of a fireworks factory. The initial explosions - three explosions in short succession according to calls from members of the public to the fire service [VVF] - presumably occurred in the vicinity of sheds No&amp;nbsp;4 and 5, which were used to store finished products (fireworks), classified as category&amp;nbsp;IV and V under the National legislation regulating explosive factories and warehouses. Observations of the effects indicate that the sheds probably exploded en masse, i.e. involving all the material contents of the sheds simultaneously. The fire service's findings suggest that, at the time of the explosion, several factory employees - including the manager and two employees related to him, who were killed instantaneously - were loading products from the storage sheds onto vehicles parked nearby. Ignition presumably occurred during the handling of the explosives. It seems that the products being loaded were to be transferred onwards onto vans parked in the yard in front of the entrance gates for shipment to the venues where they would be used, since the vans had been partially loaded but still had to be fully loaded. In the days preceding the accident, the factory had been particularly busy preparing and shipping products for many planned fireworks displays; in particular, a fireworks display for a local festival was planned for the following day. At 10.55 a.m. there was a fourth explosion, in a delayed domino effect, in shed No&amp;nbsp;8, which was used to store up to 9600&amp;nbsp;kg of category IV and V explosive material. The shed, already damaged by the shock wave from the initial explosions, was probably struck by burning debris thrown out by ongoing minor secondary blasts, and it too probably exploded en masse together with all the contents. This last explosion caused the death of a fourth employee (the son of the manager), who was hit by section of the roof of shed No&amp;nbsp;8, and caused serious injuries to a fire-fighter working at the scene, who later died from the injuries. In total, the event caused the death of 4&amp;nbsp;factory employees, serious injuries to a fire-fighter, who died in hospital approximately three months later, and injuries to 3&amp;nbsp;employees and 5&amp;nbsp;fire-fighters, who were all hospitalised and subsequently recovered. The accident caused extensive material damage, with the factory's sheds destroyed almost completely, damage to civilian facilities adjacent to the factory perimeter and related to the factory, and damage to external civilian buildings within a radius of up to 1&amp;nbsp;km. Debris of various sizes from the sheds which exploded was found within a radius of up to 1&amp;nbsp;km. Lastly, the explosions caused environmental damage as they set off a series of large-scale forest fires in the surrounding natural and rural area within a radius of 500&amp;nbsp;m which were later extinguished by the fire service and the State Forestry Corps, deploying two aircraft. The main local authorities (including the Prefecture, the Carabinieri, the police department, the judiciary [judicial inspection] and the local health authority) intervened at the scene. No action was apparently taken by the Regional Planning and Environment Office to measure soil contamination due to chemicals dispersed as a result of the explosions.&lt;/p&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;

As part of the judicial investigation, the area of the factory was sealed off and the company documentation on the premises at the time of the event was seized. As a result, although MARS inspectors were able to enter the sealed area (subject to prior authorisation from the PM at the request of the fire service), they have not been able to access the company's documentation. Given the above circumstances, it is only possible to formulate hypotheses on the causes of the accident, based on the information collected and measurements taken after the event by the inspection committee in the course of its inspection and making use of the data provided by several of the public authorities involved in post-accident operations, chiefly the local fire service and the Commander of the Carabinieri. Additional hypotheses have been put forward on the basis of information drawn from the interview with the manager's representative, the appointed expert [CTP], it being impossible to consult either the manager or his employees/family members (who were killed by the explosion). Some surviving relatives are still in a state of shock and receiving psychiatric treatment. The hypothetical conclusions based on post-accident data collected by the fire service and the Carabinieri are set out below. In the process of securing the location after the accident, primed explosive products (already fitted with electric fuses but not connected to a power supply) were found in the factory yard in front of the factory entrance and in the tool shed used as a garage for vans. It was not possible to identify the kind of primers and, consequently, if they were allowed or not inside the plant according with the national regulations. In general, under the national regulations fireworks must never be pre-armed inside the establishment. Considering the material damage sustained by the internal structures, in particular by the sheds with load-bearing walls made from reinforced concrete, and the containment walls, with evidence of disintegration and crushing, the probability is that there was a sympathetic detonation of the explosive material or an instantaneous explosion involving the entire quantity of material due to mechanical stress: this can be compatible with the potential presence in the area of the explosions of quantities of explosive products already, it is assumed, unlawfully primed. It should be added that, according to the statement of the Commander of the Carabinieri, explosive material, including primed material, was also found in the area belonging to the manager's residence and, specifically, in the vans parked in the tool shed and, lastly, fireworks were found in the basement of the tool shed. Considering the above hypotheses, it is possible to suppose that the operating procedures deployed by the company were unsafe, as also supported by the conclusions of a previous SMS inspection conducted by local Authority in 2012, which pointed out the absence of adequate operative procedures and instructions for managing the explosives production in safe conditions, in each stage of process. This aspect goes beyond the lack of information and training provided to operators who, as experts in the field may be deemed to be well aware of the dangers of handling primed materials; it suggests, rather, an excessive level of ‘confidence’ gained over time and perhaps overfamiliarity with work involving materials that in fact entail a high level of intrinsic risk. To this may be added the probable situation of working under pressure, subject to constraints of time and space, in the days immediately preceding the event on account of the many orders for firework displays which the operators themselves were called upon to carry out by virtue of their acknowledged reputation in the sector. Furthermore, given the extent of the material damage sustained by external structures impacted by debris from the disintegration of the sheds and protective walls, and based on a damage assessment by applying the TNT equivalent method to the case in point, considering the maximum quantity authorised within a shed, it may be hypothesised that the quantity of explosive in the stores at the time of the event exceeded the quantity permitted by the competent authority. Applying the above method with a highly conservative approximation of the case leads to the conclusion that the structural damage due to the pressure wave compatible with that observed on the outside buildings damaged ought to lie within a radius of less than 107&amp;nbsp;m; however, damage of this kind (lifting of the building's wooden roof, cornerstone movement, curtain wall damage, partition wall damage) were found at a radius of between 100&amp;nbsp;m and 500&amp;nbsp;m from the craters made by the explosions. Furthermore, on the subject of the quantity of explosives in stock, according to information reported by the Commander of the Carabinieri approximately 20&amp;nbsp;days after the event (13&amp;nbsp;August) some 0.2 tonnes of black powder were found stored in five drums in an abandoned hut outside the factory adjacent to the southern perimeter. There were no labels on the drums. This amount, together with the 0.43 tons found in shed No&amp;nbsp;2 following the explosion, would exceed the authorised limit of 0.5 tonnes for black powder. Lastly, we should stress the domino effect of the initial explosions upon shed No&amp;nbsp;8, first hit by the shock wave and then ignited, presumably by burning debris. In theory, compliance with National Regulations with regard to the distances between sheds should have prevented a domino effect of this kind but only if the authorised maximum quantities and types of explosives were also respected. These considerations again point to the root cause being the breach of safety requirements in terms of the quantity and type of explosive material authorised and/or stored and processed in the establishment. This is supported by the conclusions of the incident report drawn up by the local fire service, which managed the emergency response to the event. On the basis of information obtained from interviews with surviving relatives not currently in a psychological condition to have dealings with the inspection committee, the appointed expert [CTP] representing the manager reports that the operator was regularly asked to store (Authority request) quantities of explosive material entrusted to its legal custody after being confiscated by the police. This material,may be, in general, not well identified and consequently with an unknown (and potentially dangerous) behaviour, was stored in the sheds together with explosive products manufactured by the company. In particular, at the time of the accident, the appointed expert [CTP] reports that the stores held a quantity of confiscated explosive material roughly equivalent to 6 or 7&amp;nbsp;tons, in storage sheds No&amp;nbsp;4 and No&amp;nbsp;5 (where the initial series of explosions was found to have occurred). So the appointed expert [CTP] declares that the origin of explosions is probably attributable to the chemical decomposition of explosive material delivered into the company's legal custody by the police, stored in sheds No&amp;nbsp;4 and No&amp;nbsp;5 together with the company's own finished products. He therefore highlights the critical significance of the storage of unidentified confiscated explosive material which, as it loses chemical stability over time, presents an increased risk of explosive decomposition.&lt;/p&gt;"],"Other":[""]}},"CausesPlantEquipments":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"vessel/container/containment-equipment failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"component/machinery failure/malfunction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"loss of process control","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"corrosion/fatigue","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"instrument/control/monitoring-device failure","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"unexpected reaction/phase-transition","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"blockage","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"electrostatic accumulation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesHumans":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"operator error","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"operator health (includes ailments, intoxication, death, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"malicious intervention","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesOrganisationals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"management organization inadequate","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"management attitude problem","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"organized procedures","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"training/instruction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"supervision","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"staffing","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"process analysis","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"design of plant/equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"10","ItemDescription":"manufacture/construction","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"11","ItemDescription":"installation","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"12","ItemDescription":"isolation of equipment/system","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"13","ItemDescription":"maintenance/repair","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"14","ItemDescription":"testing/inspecting/recording","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"15","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"16","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"17","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}],"CausesExternals":[{"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"natural event (weather, temperature, earthquake, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"domino-effect from other accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"transport accident","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"struck by object","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"establishment safeguarding/security deficiency","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"other","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"8","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable","IsChecked":false},{"ItemId":"9","ItemDescription":"not identified","IsChecked":false}]},"Consequence_Tab":{"AccidentConsequence":{"VersionId":["3ce3a35a-63f0-4225-9efd-06dc9fe9305f"],"Consequence_Description":["&lt;p&gt;The accident caused extensive human, property and environmental damage: Human damages occurred within the establishment, comprising the instant death of 3&amp;nbsp;members of staff (including the manager) hit by the first series of explosions, the instantaneous death of a fourth member of staff (the manager's son) who had returned to to the establishment to look for his missing father and was struck by debris ejected from the fourth explosion, serious injuries suffered by a fire-fighter hit by the fourth explosion who died in hospital three months later, and injuries sustained by 3&amp;nbsp;employees and 5&amp;nbsp;fire-fighters participating in the emergency response.
