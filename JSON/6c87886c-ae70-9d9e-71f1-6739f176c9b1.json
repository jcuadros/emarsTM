It is suggested that during fire protection authority's inspection more emphasis shall be exercised to inspection of fire protection activity of the companies.

It was initiated to produce such foam makers for the capital. It is possible to reduce by seconds or minutes the time elapsing between arrival of fire signalization and initiating the fire alarm by expansion of computer system of Alarm Centre of Fire-Fighting Headquarter. It is necessary to provide suitable generally usable working clothes, boots and protective coat for the on duty staff. It is necessary to ensure protective drinks and meals supply system for staff working at accident site. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"EmergencyResponce_Descr":["The porter alarmed the fire alarm centre of fire-chief headquarters after detecting the fire by direct fire alarm phone. Extinguishing of fire was not attempted by plant personnel until arrival of fire brigade. Porters opened the entrance gates and started alarming the management of the company. The chief of fire alarm centre retrieved the fire-fighting plan of the establishment from the computer database and started execution of prescribed III. Order alarm (alarming 14 units in the first circle). The arriving units performed marching within the norm time arriving at 08:58, there was no adversely effecting factor hindering the marching of fire brigades. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fire-fighting leader confirmed the fire order III classification on the basis of exploration at site, but because of rapid spreading of fire in large area it was classified to V order at 09:06. The fire alarm centre executed the V. order alarming very fast (alarming further 6 units). Involvement of further units were necessary for exchange (from 09:42 9 units) and later for cleanup work and exploration (6 units). Aggregately 36 fire-engines and 143 firemen arrived to the fire site. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the exploration the storage building was entirely in fire, and the fire was endangering the open air storage area next to the storage building. In spite of quick intervention the propagation of fire could not prevented, the plastic canisters located on palettes were molten and linseed oil stored in canisters burned and like burning lava flow away directly endangering the jet directing firemen and fire-engines. It is necessary to note, that the fire-chief was not aware of the content of plastic canisters, he got no information regarding this matter at site. &lt;br&gt;The burning liquid spilled in the yard endangered the two neighboring buildings (paint storages), spreading the fire to these buildings would result in incalculable consequences. Because of rapid spreading of fire the alarm classification the fire-fighting leader increased the alarm classification order at 09:06. He concentrated the forces to this place for prevention of propagation of fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fire was extinguished using 36 fire engines and 143 firemen during 9 hours 1 minute. The tremendous amount of combustible material, which was stored in different vessels on palettes made the fire-fighting very dangerous and difficult. From the fire signalization arriving in the same time one could come to the conclusion that large fire occurred. The alarm centre made alarming according to the fire fighting plan, made preparation for alarming of forces prescribed for assistance. The exploration was not hindered, the detached storehouse and its surrounding was well-arranged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fire escalate in very short time to the entire area of the storehouse. The heat radiation was very intensive, but the intervention prevented escalation of fire to the adjacent storehouses. Prevention of damage in the close vicinity of storehouse was not possible, materials, vehicles located there were seriously damaged. Because of stored different type of chemicals there was explosion danger and pollution effect of released combustion products represented serious endangerment for the environment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was late information for the fire-fighting brigade that person is present in the storehouse. It was problem, that nobody could give information about types of stored materials at site. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fire-fighting management was performed at the beginning by basic management mode, later the by the organization of fire-fighting group. 4 brigades were organized: &lt;br&gt;1-1 brigade on the left and right sides of the storehouse &lt;br&gt;1 brigade for ensuring fire-fighting material supply&lt;br&gt;1 brigade for ensuring fire -fighting water supply.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The role of management staff which was complemented with principals arriving to the site was consultative, because of static fire-fighting situation. Good co-operation between management staff and fire-fighting leader facilitated the success of new tactical solution used at first time. Combined extinguishing method was determined for extinguishing of the fire: extinguishing with powder -gusher, foam-gusher and foam jets the cooling with water jets. Using powder gushers burning of liquid spilled in the yard managed to cease, and fire in the storehouse partly control. The very intensive foam braking effect of burning materials no foam cover could formed, because 80-90% of foam was destroyed in short time. Operation of 12-15 simultaneous foam jet would be required for successful fire-fighting, but only one foam-gusher was available on duty in the capital. &lt;br&gt;The series of explosion of storage vessels reignited several times the already extinguished fire. Use of AKG-800 foam-maker for forming ensured successful fire-extinguishing because of 1,5-2 meters high foam-covering. The large weight of AKG-800 foam-maker and its manual transportation in very dangerous site represented large difficulty; the fire members of fire-fighting group had no previous information about the equipment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Injuries occurred in spite of necessary care and disciplined observation of accident prevention measures, serious injury did not occurred, fast reaction of gusher-leaders saved colleagues in danger. Heat resistant protective clothing was not used, because it was obvious that the fire extinguishing will take longer than 20 minutes time. Heat resistant protective clothing the visibility is restricted, the movement is hard, in case of present fire observation of large area and fast reaction was necessary because of rapid changes. As result of high heat radiation the external surface of conventional protective coat was melted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The medical ambulance cars of emergency department ensured the treatment and transportation to hospital of injured people. The police closed down properly the surrounding area, executed the necessary traffic control. The police took part in information and rescuing of residential people, ensuring the public order. Experts of Sewage Company On The Basis Of received in time information took the necessary measures, as a result no contaminated fire-fighting water entered into the river Danube. Food supply of fire-fighting staff working continuously for many hours was not properly organised, 4 hours was necessary to organise the requested food supply by on duty officer of the Fire-Fighting Headquarter.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastUser":{"UserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"Name":["MINERVA"],"Surname":["Administrator"],"IsVisibleSensibleData":[false]},"LastDate":["2017-07-11T15:59:38.731"],"ParentCompany":{},"Region":{},"Province":{},"City":{},"PostCode":{},"Concurrency":[0]},"LockedUserId":{},"LockedDate":{},"IsLocked":[false],"IsLockedByMe":[false],"LockedUser":{}},"AccidentProfile_Tab":{"ReportingAuthority":{},"ContactPerson":{},"Reasons":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"Substances involved: greater than 5% of quantity in Column 3 of Annex I"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"Injury to persons: &gt;= 1 fatalities, &gt;= 6 hospitalizing injuries etc."},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"Immediate damage to the environment (according to Annex VI)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"Damage to property: on-site &gt;2M &amp;euro;, off-site &gt; 0.5M &amp;euro;"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"Cross-border damage: transboundary accidents"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"Interesting for lessons learned."}],"AffectedCountries":{}},"AccidentDescription_Tab":{"AccidentDescription":{"DominoEffects":[false],"NatechEvents":[false],"TransboundaryEffects":[false],"Contractors":[false],"accTypeRelease":[0],"accTypeFire":[0],"accTypeExplosion":[0],"accTypeTransport":[0],"accTypeOther":{},"IsActive":[true],"LastUserId":["a5bdd8c5-3d12-4ae5-9662-2dc3c5f23eea"],"LastDate":["2017-07-11T16:00:08.689"],"Concurrency":[0],"Translation":{"VersionId":["8b4d5585-fa14-6504-6f1d-cbb1c25e5171"],"LanguageId":["EN"],"AccidentDescription":["One person died in fire, pool fire and/or fireball evolved, where 10 firemen suffered injuries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The drums and cans containing hazardous material were exploding continuously, endangering the residential houses near-by. For that reason and/or because of developing of toxic products of combustion 17 residents were evacuated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For fire-fighting there were used 33000 litre of extinguisher-foaming material, 5000 kg of extinguisher powder and 3.5 million litre of water. The large volume fire-extinguishing water moved via the channelling toward the Danube. It was managed to close at water treatment station on time, thanks to quick action the access of extinguishing water into the living water was prevented, the river was not polluted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chronology of the event:&lt;br&gt;A former, drug-addict employee of the company crawled into the warehouse on rest-day, and after inhalation of thinner vapours became stuporous, lighted a cigarette. After this fire started, which in short time spread to the whole warehouse.&lt;br&gt;The person captured in the warehouse ran to the grid and shouted for help. The porter being in further distance ran to the site to check what happened. As he saw the warehouse in fire and the person within shaking the grid, ran for the key. After coming back he tried to unlock the door, but because of high heat-load he could not approach the building.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The cans, drums were exploding continuously, endangering the near-by residential houses and the firemen arrived for extinguishing the fire. Because of the huge heat-load 36 fire-engine and 143 firemen were fighting against the fire in turns, for more than 9 hours. For fire-fighting there were used 33000 litres of extinguisher-foaming material, 5000 kg of extinguisher powder and 3.5 million litre of water. The large volume fire-extinguishing water moved via the channelling toward the Danube. It was managed to close at water treatment station on time, thanks to quick action the access of extinguishing water into the living water was prevented, the river was not polluted. One person - the causer of fire - died in fire, 10 firemen suffered injuries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fire started between 08.40-08.50 on Saturday 26th June 1988 in the paint-store of warehouse. The detection of fire was enabled by smoke, flames and silent popping voice coming from the building (08.53). The fire-station was informed by reception via direct fire-alarm telephone. The plant staff (3 porters, 1 electrician) did not tried to extinguish the fire. The alarm-notices from the residential people arrived from 08.54, in which huge smoke and five floor high flame was mentioned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 08.58 - based on exploration - the whole warehouse was in fire, the fire endangered the open-air storage place near to the warehouse. Despite of quick action the spread of fire to cans could not be prevented, the plastic cans placed on pallets melted and the linseed oil stored in them fired floated as lava, causing direct danger of life of gusher-leaders and danger to fire-engines. The liquid in fire on the yard endangered two near-by buildings (paint-stores), the spread of fire to these buildings could have caused incalculable consequences. Because of quick spread of fire the fire-fighting leader increased the alarm-level at 09.06. At 09.08 the attempt for rescue of person captured by the warehouse, the room locked with grid was in fire, the man did not show sign of life. It was managed to force back the liquid in fire between the two stores (09.12), the fire could not spread further. A part of liquid in fire flew to the lower level underlying building site behind the warehouse, inflaming the tool hut standing on that area and/or endangering four pressure-bottle fixed to the hut. The fire-fighting leader ordered protection and evacuation of bottles, but two of them exploded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fire-fighting was done continuously by powder-, foam- and water-gusher. It was not managed to form monolithic foam-covering neither with operating foam-gusher and foam-guns together, because the liquid in fire was proved strong antifoam agent, furthermore the storage mode of materials made more difficult of forming the foam-covering (on pallets, above each other). After recognition of antifoam agent the fire-fighting leader ordered the supplementation of foam-forming compound, what would have been justified to be done earlier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The heavy smoke threatened some of the near-by residential houses, therefore action was taken to evacuate 17 person - mainly elder aged people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By 10.10 with involving other emergency units, and/or operating the powder-gusher discontinuously it was managed to stop the fire of liquid on the yard, there were no reinflame. The fire could be controlled inside the building. Meanwhile the foam-forming compound was off, the fire-fighting and cooling continued with water. The sump gullys were occluded by balled fat, the water could not drain. The liquid from the cans exploded spread on the surface of water in seconds, and compassed the gusher leaders, this way suffering burn injuries. At 10.16 arrived the foam-forming compound, the fire-fighting with foam continued. By 10.39 the fire was 90 %, by 10.45 totally extinguished. At 10.45 some heated box under the pallets exploded and the liquid spread reignited the fire, the fire-fighting continued. The flash of liquid spread on surface of water caused injuries again at 10.56.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because of serial reinflames and explosions inside and in the environment of the building the total extinguishing of the fire could not be achieved, but controlling the fire-sources the fire did not spread to larger area. The fire-fighting leader ordered the notice of Water-treatment Company, i. e. huge volume of extinguishing water polluted with high quantity chemicals will arrive to water treatment plant, they were asked to do the actions needed and/or to clean the occluded sump gullys at site. Thanks to the notice on time the responsible persons separated the polluted water, this way no polluted extinguishing water entered the Danube.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 11.25 the mortal remains of victim was found.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was not managed to prevent the evaporation of inflammable liquid spread, causing continuous reinflame, for solving this fireman captain leader of Operative Unit of Department of the Interior's Fire-fighting National Headquarter, proposed forming of 1,5-2 meters high foam-covering, which was a key tactical solution in view of fire-fighting. The foam-covering was formed by AKG-800 foam-maker and with EVAM foam-forming compound. The equipment was used up to now only in oil industry for consolidation of extinguishing of large-surfaced fire, evolved in salvager. The fire and smoke-production stopped in 10 minutes after the equipment arrived at site and operated, producing total foam-covering on the site affected. The produced foam-covering was stable also on morning of next day, there was no need for complementation. The total extinguishing of fire was effected on the whole site and in the building after introducing the foam-covering (22.08).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;
