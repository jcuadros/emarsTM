In these ovens the feed stream naphtha is cracked into smaller molecules. Periodically these ovens need to be decoked to assure an optimal cracking of the molecules. When the accident took place the oven B20 had to be decoked.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;To start the decoking procedure, the feed to the oven must be closed. Next the oven must be flushed with steam. Afterwards an air flow is sent into the oven to burn the carbon, which is deposed at the inner walls of the cracking tubes, in a controlled manner. &lt;br&gt;Around 19.15h the naphtha feed to the oven B20 was stopped by closing a automatic valve. The 4 control valves (not at the entrance of the oven were also closed. The operator in the control room performed these actions. After performing these remote actions, some manual operations had to take place in the neighborhood of the ovens. A figure indicating the configuration of the valves involved in the accident and their final state after the accident is attached to the report.&lt;br&gt;The manual actions that had to be performed were the following ones:&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; First a manual valve placed just before the automatic valve on the naphtha feed had to be closed. On the figure this manual valve is situated left from the automatic valve;&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Next the naphtha feed line had to be flushed with steam for a short period (called short steam flush). To do so the automatic valve had to be opened manually;&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Afterwards the drain situated between the manual valve and the automatic valve had to be opened to let the steam escape. By doing so the remaining naphtha in the feed pipe between the manual and automatic valve could be removed;&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; After the remaining naphtha was removed, a blind plate had to be placed under the manual valve, in order to guarantee that during the decoking of the ovens it is impossible to sent naphtha to the oven (by mistake).&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Finally the oven had to be flushed with steam during 30 minutes (called long steam flush).&lt;br&gt;Just before the accident happened the two victims were situated in the neighborhood of the valves that had to be manipulated. Other operators who were working 30 to 40 m away from that place suddenly heard a thud explosion followed by an intensive fire.&lt;br&gt;Because sprinklers were situated above the valves, a water curtain was available in the immediate surroundings of the valves and monitors were available to the north and south of the place of the fire, the fire was extinguished after a few minutes.&lt;br&gt;After the fire was extinguished it was established that the drain situated right from the automatic valve was opened and the plug, which is usually used to guarantee that no fluid is leaking out of the drain (if the drain valve leaks a little bit), was found on the floor. This drain was another one than the one described in the list of manual actions that had to be performed before the oven could be decoked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"],"TypeOther":[""]}},"ADReleaseMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADReleaseInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"fluid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"fluid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"solid release to air"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"solid release to ground"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"solid release to water"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":true,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADFireInitiating":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"not known / not applicable"}],"ADExplosionMajors":[{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"2","ItemDescription":"BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"5","ItemDescription":"dust explosion"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"6","ItemDescription":"explosive decomposition (of unstable material)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"1","ItemDescription":"pressure burst (rupture of pressure system)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"3","ItemDescription":"rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"4","ItemDescription":"runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)"},{"IsChecked":false,"ItemId":"7","ItemDescription":"VCE (vapour cloud explosion;

The operator, who had the function of \"oven operator\" in that shift, had the intention to follow them (after he found his helmet).&lt;br&gt;One of the operators in training has opened the drain right from the automatic valve. A lot of naphtha came out of the drain. The amount of naphtha that was released was much more than he expected and much more than the amount that came free the other times he performed this task. The amount of naphtha that came free must have been 300 to 400l, this is the contents of the line between the automatic valve and the inlet of the oven. Once he noticed that a lot of naphtha that was released, he wanted to close the drain valve, but it was already too late. He saw the cloud of naphtha was ignited by the hot walls of the nearby oven. The description of the actions the operator in training performed was in line with the situation in which the installation was found after the fire. The operator in training claimed that he did not perform the actions in another way than he normally did to decoke an oven. Although he was still following the training program to become \"oven operator\" he performed this task already several times (but he did not now how many times).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Direct causes&lt;br&gt;One of the most important causes of this accident is the fact that two operators who were still following the training program to become \"oven operator\" were performing tasks without any supervision.&lt;br&gt;The day the accident happened there were enough operators available in the evening shift to fulfill all necessary functions. In the shift it was decided that the manual tasks before decoking oven B20 should be performed by the two victims. The operators in the shift believed that the two victims had already enough knowledge and experience to perform these actions correctly. One hour before they had to perform these tasks, the operator with the function \"oven operator\" explained to them that they were going to decoke oven B20 and what they had to do. Unfortunately this was not put into a report. The moment the operator in the control room announced that de automatic valve on the naphtha feed was closed, the two victims got the instruction to perform the manual tasks. The operator who had the function of \"oven operator\" had the intention to follow them after he found his helmet. The moment the operator left the building the fire already started.&lt;br&gt;In the shift there was a lot of confidence in the knowledge of the two operators in training. Their training file contained already personal notes with the answer on the question which actions they had to perform for the decoking of an oven. The answer of the second victim was correct, but it described the tasks more generally. The answer of the first victim contained all the details of the manual actions that had to be taken before the oven can be decoked. The operators in training answered that question as a preparation of the examination that they had to pass to become a certified operator to perform the function of \"oven operator\".&lt;br&gt;During the investigation of the accident it was found that the two victims had followed an operator performing the manual tasks before the decoking of an oven several times. The ovens in the naphtha cracking unit are installed by two. Therefore the configuration of the naphtha feed and the corresponding valves of the odd ovens is the mirror image of the configurations of the even ovens. Because the two operators in training assisted the manual actions on several ovens, they where aware of the fact that there are two \"mirror image\" configurations. Although it could be demonstrated that both victims followed the manual tasks several times, it is not recorded how many times they just looked how the \"oven operator\" did it and how many times they did it themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indirect causes&lt;br&gt;As mentioned above the second victim was convinced that the day of the accident he did not do anything different than what he had learned the past months. If this fact was true, it was possible that an operator gave him the wrong instructions during the training period. It is always possible that in order to save some time someone did not perform the short steam flush correctly, but would open the drain directly to release the naphtha between the manual and automatic valve (2 to 3 l naphtha) before performing the long steam flush. If on the day of the accident the second victim would perform the manual tasks in this way and made a mistake between the drain left and right from the automatic valve, this could explain what went wrong the evening of the accident.&lt;br&gt;To exclude that the performing of the manual tasks before decoking an oven had been instructed in the wrong manner, the records stored in the computer system of the decoking actions during the last few months have been printed out. During the short steam flush the automatic valve must be lifted manually. This action is detected on the computer system. If someone would release the naphtha by opening the drain, without a short steam flush, then the automatic valve is not lifted. This difference can be detected by the computer system. The printed files indicated that the past months the ovens were 60 times decoked. The analysis of the printed files also showed that in more than 90% of the cases, it is absolutely sure that the short steam flush was performed correctly. For the other 10 % it was noticed that in some cases it was sure that the actions were not performed correctly, but for some cases it could not be detected if the actions were performed right of wrong. The data stored in the computer system only gives information about the signals that took more than 30 seconds. The short steam flush mostly takes a few minutes, but is more efficiently not to open the automatic valve during two minutes, but to flush several times during a shorter period (to achieve a pumping effect). This means that if an operator lifts the automatic valve 5 times during 20 seconds, these actions are not stored in the computer system, because each period is less than 30 seconds. In the cases where it was sure that the actions were wrong it appeared that these actions could not be related to one shift ore one person.
